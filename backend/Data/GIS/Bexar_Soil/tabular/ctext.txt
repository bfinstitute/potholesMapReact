Ecological Site Concept
The Clay Loam ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie, dominated by little bluestem. The soils are shallow to deep and characterized by their clay loam texture.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep, well drained soils that have moderate to slow permeability. The the parent material is calcareous alluvium weathered from limestone hills. In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark grayish-brown, calcareous clay loam about 10 to 18 inches thick over a brown calcareous clay loam subsoil. Depth to bedrock ranges from 22 to more than 60 inches below the surface. The available water capacity is low to moderate. The following dominant soil series are: Altoga, Austin, Blum, Bonham, Culp, Cuthand, Howe, Krum, Lamar, Lewisville, Lott, McLennan, Seawillow, Sunev, Venus, and Whiteright. 

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is a true prairie with a few large live oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional mottes. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, 5 percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Little bluestem, Indiangrass, and big bluestem dominate the site. Other important grasses include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), switchgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Florida paspalum. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, hackberry, pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and elm, along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference prairie community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (i.e. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and sideoats grama. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and Texas wintergrass will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Prairie State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Soils are fertile with good permeability and produce abundant high quality palatable forage.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high.

Limestone fragments and rocks sometimes occur in the profile or outcrop on the soil surface, but not to the extent that they impair the production of native vegetation. Plant-soil moisture relationships are good. In healthy condition, rills, gullies, wind-scoured areas, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. It should be noted that there may be inclusions of other soils that because of mapping scale are not divided out. These may include some shallow soils with sporadic surface limestone fragments typical of the Eckrant series. The following representative soils associated with the Clay Loam ecological site are Bolar, Krum, and Pratley. These are the representative map units associated with the Clay Loam ecological site: Bolar clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes Krum clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes Krum clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes Krum-Pratley association, gently undulating Pratley clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes

Reference Community
This is the reference or interpretive community for the site. The description is based on early range site descriptions, clipping data, the professional consensus of experienced range specialists, and analysis of field work. In reference condition, this site is a fire/herbivory managed, tallgrass savannah with about 10 percent woody canopy cover. Elm and hackberry trees occur along small streams, and Texas live oak trees or motts are widely scattered. Texas live oak can exist as both a tree and as a mott depending upon fire frequency or other disturbance as it is a vigorous root sprouter. Some juniper may occur depending upon the last fire or removal. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous plant community. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants and may be locally dominant. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass occurred in small quantities. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), silver (Bothriochloa saccharoides), and pinhole bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis var. perforata), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and tall/meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are also prevalent but in lesser amounts. The site grows an abundance of palatable forbs and legumes such as Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), velvet bundleflower (Desmanthus velutinus), and trailing wildbean (Strophostyles helvola). This plant community is very stable and can withstand short term droughts although production will fluctuate accordingly. If the site is abused by overgrazing of the site with cattle, a reduction of the more palatable tall and mid grasses, forbs, and legumes will occur. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver and pinhole bluestem, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) will increase. Texas wintergrass, along with a small amount of wildryes (Elymus spp.), often dominates the site and furnishes considerable cool-season forage. The cool season plants will also be more prominent when abundant fall rains occur. Fire on a 5- to 10-year frequency will help suppress shrubs and add to the cycling of minerals and nutrients. Fires prevent excessive buildup of litter. Research on the effects of fire on soil organisms reveal complex results and are ecosystem dependent. Soil fauna may decrease following a burn if the burn leaves the soil bare and not insulated (Wright, 1982). It is anticipated that a burn on this site, leaving some litter on the soil, may initially depress soil fauna but then experience an increase following a burn mainly because the sun warms the ground quicker. This leads to more rapid nutrient cycling and increased production and quality. In general, if burning follows historic fire return intervals, the litter and soil fauna will be sustainable (Scifres, 1980). Grazing has a dual effect in maintaining this grassland. Grazing assists in nutrient cycling by digesting coarse grasses and depositing the digested plants through manure back to the soil surface. However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on shallow loams and clay loams over limestone bedrock. The reference vegetation consists of an oak savannah including live oak and Texas red oak, with an understory of tall and midgrasses, shrubs and forbs. Without periodic fire or brush management, woody species may increase and dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Adobe ecological site, the soils are shallow to moderately deep, usually gravelly, light-colored loam or clay loam over weakly or moderately cemented limestone with thin beds of indurated limestone. Rock fragments in the surface horizons are about 20 percent and up to 85 percent in the subsoil. There are gravelly to extremely gravelly or paragravelly to extremely paragravelly texture modifiers throughout the soil profile. The permeability of the soil is moderate and the permeability of the paralithic material is very slow to slow. On erosional sideslope positions, the organic matter development in the topsoil is low. Because of high runoff and high calcium carbonate content, the soils are droughty. They do not support a dense cover of plants, which require high amounts of water and plant nutrients. Runoff is rapid, even under good plant cover. Forage grown on the site is usually low in nutritive value and must be supplemented, especially with phosphorus as the high calcium levels tie up the phosphorus. Soils on the lower slopes of the site have organic material in the soil surface and are often characterized by the presence of Texas oaks. These sites occur on sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Because of the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The following representative soils associated with the Adobe ecological site are Brackett, Kerrville, and Real. These are the representative map units associated with the Adobe ecological site: Brackett association, undulating Brackett-Rock outcrop complex, 1 to 12 percent slopes Kerrville association, undulating Real-Oplin complex, 1 to 20 percent slopes

Reference Community
This is the interpretive or representative plant community for the Adobe site. The data for this plant community is derived from field data collection, review of historical descriptions and professional interpretation of several representative locations. The reference plant community for the site is a plant community composed of tall and mid grasses plus scattered live oaks. The overstory canopy averages about 10 percent for the site and consists primarily of live oak, but may include Texas oak and sumac species (Rhus spp.). Other shrubs common to the site are algerita (Mahonia trifoliata), sotol (Dasylirion texanum), sacahuista (Nolina texana) and several associated species. Mid and tall grasses dominate much of the site, though portions of these sites often supported a shrub and tree communities in mosaic patterns along with some seeps or spring flow. The integrity of the reference plant community can be maintained with a few management practices. Hand cutting or mechanical alternatives are options to keep this site in a mosaic Grassland Savannah Community. Prescribed burning is also a natural, effective and economical practice for the flatter slopes of this site. Individual Plant Treatment (IPT) alternatives are other sources of brush management, which may be effective on the steeper slopes. When retrogression is livestock induced, the tall grasses are replaced by a dominance of mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), and perennial threeawn (Aristida spp.). With continued abuse, the site is dominated by perennial threeawn, muhly spp. (Muhlenbergia), poverty dropseed (Sporobolus vaginiflorus), hairy tridens, cedar sedge (Carex planostachys), and rabbit tobacco (Evax prolifera). Ashe juniper will readily invade the site and become dominate when no management efforts are applied and regardless of grazing pressure except for goats.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on drainages with deep alluvial soils. Reference vegetation includes a mixture of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. Overtime, without fire or brush management, woody species may dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Loamy Bottomland ecological site, the soils are very deep, loamy, and calcareous. They are well drained, and permeability is moderate to rapid. The site receives extra water from stream flooding and as runoff from adjacent higher sites. Surface runoff is slow and some areas are flooded for short periods. The soils have a high water holding capacity for plant use and are naturally fertile. The soil maybe underlain with material comprised of 65 to 90 percent rounded alluvial gravels, cobbles, and stones at depths of 12 to greater than 80 inches. The site produces high yields of palatable and nutritious forage. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site.

Reference Community
This plant community is a Tallgrass Savannah Bottomland with high plant diversity and structure. The information for this plant community is interpolated from historical writings, NRCS range site descriptions, limited clipping studies, and professional consensus. This is the diagnostic or reference plant community for the Loamy Bottomland site. Pecan, live oak, walnut, sycamore, cypress, hackberry (Celtis spp.), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia.), western soapberry (Sapindus saponaria), cottonwood, and willow (Salix spp.) shade 10 to 30 percent of the ground. This is the preferred site for pecan. The understory is composed principally of little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, southwestern bristlegrass, Virginia wildrye, and perennial forbs, with smaller amounts of shrubs and woody vines. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass, along with numerous forbs and browse species occur immediately adjacent to watercourses. These species have a positive effect on streambank stabilization during flooding events. Removal of these species by over-harvesting and other effects leads to increased streambank erosion and drainage of the water table in some instances. Plants growing at the edge of the stream such as spikerush (Eliocharis spp.) and knotgrass (Paspalum distichum) can exhibit above ground production levels of 6,198 pounds per acre with root biomass of 27, 667 and 24,527 pounds per acre respectively. Root lengths of these plants have been recorded as high as 22 and 18.8 miles per square foot respectively (Cornwall, 1998). Any impact that excessively removes leaf material of the grasses over long periods of time will force a vegetational shift from tallgrass to midgrass then eventually to a cool season grass community. Birds import seeds from numerous tree and shrub species, the major one being Ashe juniper. Left unmanaged, the site will transition to a woodland of hardwood species with a dense understory of juniper and other shrubby species. Canopy cover can then be as high as 100 percent.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on very shallow and shallow clay loam soils over indurated limestone bedrock. The reference vegetation includes tall and midgrasses along with numerous forbs and scattered mottes of live oak. Without fire or brush management, juniper and other woody species are likely to increase across the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Low Stony Hill ecological site, these soils are very shallow or shallow to indurated limestone. Depth of bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches. The soil is a black clayey soil and is neutral to alkaline. Subrounded to angular pebbles, cobbles, and stones of limestone comprise 35 to 70 percent by volume of the soil. Surface fragments reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The soils are fertile, usually have good structure, and take in water readily. Their fertility and moisture-holding capacity, however, is limited by soil depth and fragment volume. Fractures in the limestone bedrock, on the other hand, generally contain fine soil particles and store moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. Forage produced on the site is of good quality. These sites occur on interfluves and sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units.

Reference Community
The data for this community is derived from field data collections and professional consensus. This site is a fire managed, open grassland with scattered oak mottes with about 10 to 20 percent tree canopy. The live oak is most abundant along watercourses, where elm (Ulmus spp.) and hackberry (Celtis spp.) trees also grow. Under a fire regime, the live oak can exist both as a tree and as a mott or thicket as it is a vigorous root sprouter. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants, and may even dominate locally. Also native to the site, but occurring less frequency or in lesser amounts are the wildryes (Elymus spp.), Sideoats grama, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), feathery bluestems (Bothriochloa spp.), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). The site also grows an abundance of forbs, shrubs and woody vines. Overstocking and thus overgrazing by domesticated animals can cause a decline and even the elimination of numerous plants from this community. As the plant community degenerates, big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, and the wildryes decrease. Sideoats grama, tall dropseed, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) are initial increasers on the site. Prolonged overuse of these plants usually results in a community of Texas wintergrass, curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri), buffalograss, and woody species. The following grasses and forbs are commonly found on this site in a deteriorated condition: Western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), Broomweed (Amphiachyris spp.), prairie coneflower (Ratibida columnifera), Snow-on-the-Mountain (Euphorbia marginata), silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), Leavenworth eryngo (Eryngium leavenworthii), twin-leaf senna (Cassia roemariana), gray goldaster (Heterotheca canescens), horehound (Marrabium vulgare), evax (Evax spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), red grama (Bouteloua trifida), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus panniculatus), windmillgrasses (Chloris spp.), and annual brome grasses (Bromus spp.).

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on gravelly clay loam soils on steep slopes. The reference vegetation includes a savannah of live oak and Texas red oak with midgrasses, tallgrasses, forbs and few shrubs. Without periodic fire or other brush management, juniper and other woody species will likely increase across the site.

Soil Features
The representative soils of this site are very shallow, shallow, and moderately deep, usually gravelly, light-colored loam and clay loam over soft limestone. Because of slope, runoff is rapid even under good plant cover. In the absence of plant cover and residues, the soils crust readily. The soil formed in residuum over interbedded limestone and marl. These soils are strongly calcareous and have low water holding capacity. For these reasons, the site is droughty. Forage grown on this site is usually low in plant nutrients, especially phosphorus. In a representative profile, the surface layer is a pale brown gravelly clay loam ranging from 0 to 15 inches in depth. The substratum in the Kerrville Series is 15 to 24 inches of marl with indurated limestone bedrock at 24 to 30 inches. In the Real and Brackett Series, the substratum ranges from 13 to 60 inches of interbedded marl. In these two series, after 20 inches, the potential for hitting indurated limestone bedrock increases with depth. Most map units contain slopes that are convex and range from 8 percent to 30 percent slopes on Steep Adobe sites. Kerrville and Brackett soils may range from 20 percent to 60 percent. Horizontal outcrops of limestone give the slopes a stair-stepped or benched appearance. Angular limestone pebbles and cobbles are on the surface of some areas. Sites with less than 20 percent slopes are more accessible to vehicle and livestock traffic. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative soils associated with the Steep Adobe ecological site are Brackett, Kerrville, and Real. These are the representative map units associated with the Steep Adobe ecological site: Brackett-Real association, hilly Kerrville-Real association, hilly

Reference Community
The Mid-Tallgrass Savannah (1.1) will be the reference community as it is perceived to have been the most extensive community. The data for this community is derived from old range site descriptions, professional consensus, and professional interpretation of collected data. This community is composed of mid and tall grasses plus scattered live oaks, Texas oaks, shrubs, forbs, and juniper. Percent canopy for this site is variable depending on the geologic formations which influence vegetation types. The overstory canopy may average about 20 percent for the site, with isolated areas being very dense and others being very open. Common woody species will be live oak, Texas oak, Ashe juniper, Bigelow oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba), sumac walnut (Juglans spp.), madrone, and several associated species. Tall and mid grasses dominate the open areas throughout the site while far less herbaceous cover may exist in the shrub and tree community. Because of slope direction and exposure, woody species will vary. For example, Lacey (Quercus laceyi), Bigelow oak, and Ashe juniper are found more on the north facing slopes while the drier shrubland or thinner woody species occurs on the south facing slopes. Some seeps or spring flow would be present to add to the mosaic pattern of the site. Periodic fires and limited grazing by bison and other herbivores were natural processes that maintained this mosaic plant community. When species such as little bluestem, Indiangrass, sideoats grama, and Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia) are grazed out of the plant community, herbaceous species are replaced by Wright's threeawn (Aristida wrightii), canyon and seep muhly, and Ashe juniper. If heavy grazing continues for many years, retrogression of the plant community will occur and species such as Ashe juniper and other low succession species will increase. With no brush control and continued overgrazing, all palatable plants will disappear and juniper and oaks will dominate the site. It should be noted that Ashe juniper will also increase independently of grazing as its seeds are spread by birds and other animals. Ashe juniper (which originally occurred as a mosaic along more protected rocky, craggy outcrops on the steeper portions of the side where it was protected from historic fires) may increase to form a dense canopy and will suppress other vegetation. Soil, plant, and watershed health indicators are negatively impacted when the site is allowed to deteriorate. The integrity of the Reference Plant Community can be maintained with a few management practices. Brush control, proper stocking rates, and deferments can allow the site to respond positively relative to plant and soil health. Hand cutting of juniper and/or prescribed burning are examples of viable practices for the flatter slopes of this site. Individual Plant Treatment (IPT) alternatives are other options which may be effective. The Reference Plant community is a stable community with sunlight energy cycling through several functional groups such as warm season grasses, cool season grasses, trees, and shrubs. Erosion does occur naturally along steeper drains but for the most part, the site is stable.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clay Loam ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie, dominated by little bluestem. The soils are shallow to deep and characterized by their clay loam texture.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep, well drained soils that have moderate to slow permeability. The the parent material is calcareous alluvium weathered from limestone hills. In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark grayish-brown, calcareous clay loam about 10 to 18 inches thick over a brown calcareous clay loam subsoil. Depth to bedrock ranges from 22 to more than 60 inches below the surface. The available water capacity is low to moderate. The following dominant soil series are: Altoga, Austin, Blum, Bonham, Culp, Cuthand, Howe, Krum, Lamar, Lewisville, Lott, McLennan, Seawillow, Sunev, Venus, and Whiteright. 

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is a true prairie with a few large live oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional mottes. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, 5 percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Little bluestem, Indiangrass, and big bluestem dominate the site. Other important grasses include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), switchgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Florida paspalum. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, hackberry, pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and elm, along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference prairie community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (i.e. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and sideoats grama. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and Texas wintergrass will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Prairie State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Soils are fertile with good permeability and produce abundant high quality palatable forage.

The Chalky Ridge site is a true tallgrass prairie. The sites are characterized by very shallow to moderately deep soils that are high in calcium carbonate.

Soil Features
The site consists of very shallow to moderately deep, well drained soils that are very slowly to moderately slowly permeability. The upland soils were formed in calcareous chalk and the terrace soils were formed in gravelly, clayey, and sandy alluvial sediments. In a representative profile the surface layer is light brownish gray, gravelly clay loam about 10 inches thick.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community and is characterized as a tallgrass prairie with scattered trees and low-growing shrubs as well as a diverse population of perennial forbs. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous component of the site. Other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), dropseeds, hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), slim tridens (Tridens muticus var. muticus), rough tridens (Tridens muticus var. elongatus), buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), and curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri).

Scattered shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include live oak, hackberry, elm (Ulmus spp.), bumelia (Sideroxylon lanuginosum) skunkbush sumac (Rhus aromatica), and agarito (Mahonia trifoliolata). The reference Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) will transition to the Midgrass Prairie Community (1.2) with lack of fire, lack of brush control, long-term drought, repeated, long-term growing-season defoliation, and/or other repeated critical growing-season stress. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the grasses and forbs with the least tolerance for disturbance and highest moisture requirements (i.e. Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem. As shrub canopy cover increases, little bluestem will decrease and shade and drought tolerant midgrasses and forbs will increase in composition.

These sites occur on moderately deep to deep clay loam soils over limestone. The reference vegetation on these upland sites consists of tallgrasses, numerous forbs, few shrubs and scattered live oak mottes. Without fire or brush management, woody species are likely to increase across the site. Grazing management is key to maintain the reference vegetation.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Clay Loam ecological site, the soils of this site are dark grayish brown, moderately deep to very deep clays or clay loams. Limestone fragments and rocks sometimes occur in the profile or outcrop on the soil surface, but not to the extent that they impair the production of native vegetation. Plant-soil moisture relationships are good. In healthy condition, rills, gullies, wind-scoured areas, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. It should be noted that there may be inclusions of other soils that because of mapping scale are not divided out.

Reference Community
This is the reference or interpretive community for the site. The description is based on early range site descriptions, clipping data, the professional consensus of experienced range specialists, and analysis of field work. In reference condition, this site is a fire/herbivory managed, tallgrass savannah with about 10 percent woody canopy cover. Elm and hackberry trees occur along small streams, and Texas live oak trees or motts are widely scattered. Texas live oak can exist as both a tree and as a mott depending upon fire frequency or other disturbance as it is a vigorous root sprouter. Some juniper may occur depending upon the last fire or removal. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous plant community. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants and may be locally dominant. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass occurred in small quantities. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), silver (Bothriochloa saccharoides), and pinhole bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis var. perforata), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and tall/meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are also prevalent but in lesser amounts. The site grows an abundance of palatable forbs and legumes such as Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), velvet bundleflower (Desmanthus velutinus), and trailing wildbean (Strophostyles helvola). This plant community is very stable and can withstand short term droughts although production will fluctuate accordingly. If the site is abused by overgrazing of the site with cattle, a reduction of the more palatable tall and mid grasses, forbs, and legumes will occur. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver and pinhole bluestem, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) will increase. Texas wintergrass, along with a small amount of wildryes (Elymus spp.), often dominates the site and furnishes considerable cool-season forage. The cool season plants will also be more prominent when abundant fall rains occur. Fire on a 5- to 10-year frequency will help suppress shrubs and add to the cycling of minerals and nutrients. Fires prevent excessive buildup of litter. Research on the effects of fire on soil organisms reveal complex results and are ecosystem dependent. Soil fauna may decrease following a burn if the burn leaves the soil bare and not insulated (Wright, 1982). It is anticipated that a burn on this site, leaving some litter on the soil, may initially depress soil fauna but then experience an increase following a burn mainly because the sun warms the ground quicker. This leads to more rapid nutrient cycling and increased production and quality. In general, if burning follows historic fire return intervals, the litter and soil fauna will be sustainable (Scifres, 1980). Grazing has a dual effect in maintaining this grassland. Grazing assists in nutrient cycling by digesting coarse grasses and depositing the digested plants through manure back to the soil surface. However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

Ecological Site Concept
The Deep Redlands have non-calcareous soils over limestone with a depth greater than 2- inches. Surface fragments 3 inches in size are less than 20 percent. The reference vegetation includes an oak savannah dominated by tallgrasses and post oaks, along with numerous forbs and other oak species. Without fire or brush management, junipers and other woody species will likely increase on the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Deep Redland ecological site, the soils are reddish brown, moderately deep, non-calcareous clays, clay loams or loams. They are underlain by slightly fractured indurated limestone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Plant roots penetrate the crevices, which are usually filled with reddish brown clay. Limestone fragments, cherts, cobbles and stones sometimes occur on the surface and may make up as much as 15 percent of the soil by volume. When dry, the soils crack and take in water rapidly. When wet, the cracks close, and the soils become sticky and plastic and take in water very slowly. Light showers are ineffective on the site, which favors the growth of deep-rooted perennial plants. When plant residues are inadequate, soil condition deteriorates and heavy surface crusts develop. In this condition water intake is very slow, runoff is rapid, erosion is a hazard, and grass recovery is slow. The mineral content and reaction of these soils enable the site to produce highly nutritious forage. In association with other sites, Deep Redland is usually the preferred grazing area. These sites occur on more stable hillslopes on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to insure the soils are correct for the site.

Reference Community
The Oak Savannah Community (1.1) is the interpretive plant community for this. The historic plant community is a fire/grazing climax savannah composed of tall grasses. The overstory shades 10 to 20 percent of the site and consists primarily of post oak, but may include Bigelow oak (Quercus buckleyi), Texas red oak (Quercus texana), Texas live oak (Quercus fusiformis), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and several associated species. The post oak and blackjack oak are signature key indicators of the Deep Redland site. Occasionally however there may only be Texas live oak. The role of fire and grazing was to keep sunlight energy flowing through the deep-rooted trees and grasses, accelerate the mineral and nutrient cycle and to capture the optimum amount of rainfall. The removal or alteration of these ecological disturbances can trigger the plant community to change. The total removal of grazing animals may, in fact, accelerate this change. Juniper is added to the site via droppings from perching birds and small mammals that eat the seeds. Ashe juniper, which is a non-sprouting woody plant easily controlled by fire, and other woody species will increase without fire or some form of brush management. Once Ashe juniper encroachment can be easily controlled with prescribed fire until the plants reach exceeds about 6 feet in height, fire options become limited. Without intervention, the Ashe juniper will continue to increase and move towards the Oak/Juniper Grassland plant community. This may occur in as little as five years.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on steep, shallow soils with numerous stones and/or boulders present. Reference vegetation includes an oak savannah with mid and tallgrasses, forbs and numerous shrubs. These sites have historically carried more woody species due to some areas being protected from recurring fires. However, if fire is removed completely, woody species are likely to increase across the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Steep Rocky ecological site, these soils are very shallow or shallow to indurated limestone. Depth of bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches. The soil is a black clayey soil and is neutral to alkaline. Stones and boulders cover 35 to 65 percent of the soil surface. Ledges of hard limestone outcrop on the contour, giving a banded appearance. The soils are fertile, usually have good structure, and take in water readily. Their fertility and moisture-holding capacity, however, is limited by soil depth and fragment volume. Fractures in the limestone bedrock, on the other hand, generally contain fine soil particles and store some moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. Forage produced on the site is of good quality. These sites occur on sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative soil associated with the Steep Rocky ecological site is Eckrant. These are the representative map units associated with the Steep Rocky ecological site: Eckrant-Rock outcrop association, steep Eckrant-Kerrville association, steep

Reference Community
The Mid- and Tallgrass Savannah Community is the interpretive plant community for this and is a diverse mosaic. The information for this site is derived from vegetation inventories and professional opinion of range trained individuals. It is recognized the north slopes will have denser stands of juniper, however, the south slope is selected as the interpretive or diagnostic plant community as it is more dynamic. The density and frequency of woody vegetation is strongly dependent on the presence or absence of fractured limestone and exposure. Where non-fractured geology exists, canopies will be less dense. Large deep-rooted trees are rare. Northern facing exposures have higher canopy covers and larger trees than southern exposures. This site was referred to as a ""cedar brake"" by early explorers (Roemer, 1846) because of the juniper dominance in several locations. The absence or presence of juniper was directly related to the fire frequency and intensity but many times was limited by rock outcrops, lack of fuel or escarpments. The overstory canopy may be as much as 35 percent. Moreover, the canopy varied considerably over the full range of the site. The woody canopy consists primarily of Texas live oak, Texas red oak, Ashe juniper, white shin oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba), Lacey oak (Quercus laceyi), and several associated species. Unique indicator plants such as Lindheimer's silk tassel (Garrya ovata var. lindheimeri), Texas madrone (Arbutus xalapensis), bigtooth maple, escarpment black cherry (Prunus serotina), and walnut species (Juglans spp.) occurred in fractured limestone. Numerous forbs such as zexmenia (Wedelia spp.), Dalea (Dalea spp.), sundrop (Calyophus spp.), bundleflower (Desmanthus spp.), and gayfeather (Liatris spp.) frequent the site. Mid and tallgrasses are dominants of the site although a large portion of these sites often supported a shrub and tree community. The structure of many of the woody plants on this site, such as live oak, can exist either as a tree or as a shrub or thicket because of their resprouting ability following fire or top damage. Juniper is the exception, being a non-sprouter. Not only did periodic fires maintain the reference plant community in a mosaic nature but droughts are known to kill woody plants such as live oak and juniper (Wills, 2006). Retrogression of the site comes mainly from juniper. Juniper functions as an increaser on this site as it is native. Heavy browsing by livestock and wildlife weakens palatable browse and offers juniper an opportunity to increase. When retrogression is cattle induced (on the lower ranges of the slope), little bluestem, green sprangletop, sideoats grama, and the minor species Indiangrass, big bluestem, and palatable forbs are the primary decreasers. Feathery bluestems (Bothriochloa spp.), tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus var. compositus), Texas wintergrass, tridens (Tridens spp.), threeawn (Aristida spp.), and woody species are increasers. Slim tridens (Tridens muticus), rough tridens (Tridens muticus var. elongatus), and threeawn (Aristida spp.) are the most persistent of the grasses under abusive use. Juniper can increase regardless of browsing. Seeds eaten by birds and deposited in the understory of other woody species will germinate and establish in the absence of fire. Over a period of time, the juniper will eventually dominate its surrogate woody plant. Other wildlife species will also eat the juniper berries then fecally deposit them over the site (Smeins, 1997). This process may take 20 or so years depending upon the rate of introduction and the fire frequency. Once juniper reaches approximately a 30 percent canopy, a threshold is being approached. At this point, the fine fuel necessary for an effective fire is diminished except for severe, catastrophic type fires. Because of the steep nature of this site, only a very few management practices can be used for maintenance. Hand cutting of juniper is an example to keep the canopy open enough to maintain some vegetative cover even though it is labor intensive. Mechanical clipping can be done on the lower slope classes. If selective removal is done, there is usually enough seed source for the site to recover once historic disturbances are returned. It is recognized that fire did not completely burn this site nor is it always feasible to burn because of difficult terrain.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on shallow calcareous clays over hard limestone. Reference vegetation includes tall and midgrasses, numerous forbs, and few scattered shrubs. Without periodic fire or other brush management, juniper and other woody species are likely to increase on the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Shallow ecological site, the soils are shallow, calcareous clays. The soil material is underlain by hard limestone at a depth of 8 to 20 inches. Limestone fragments are typically less than 15 percent by volume but may range up to 35 percent. These soils take in water readily when they have good cover of mid to tall grasses and plant residue. Surface crusting is common when plant cover and soil conditions deteriorate. Fractures in the limestone bedrock generally contain fine soil particles and store moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. The plants on this site are relatively unpalatable because of low phosphorus content which occurs because of the limited depth and high lime content. It should be noted that this site may contain small inclusions of other soils/sites, such as Clay Loam or Low Stony Hill, that were not delineated separately because of mapping intensity. Field investigations and verification should always preclude any inventory efforts. The following representative soils associated with the Shallow ecological site are Doss and Purves. These are the representative map units associated with the Shallow ecological site: Doss silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes Doss-Brackett association, undulating Purves association, undulating

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire managed, tall and midgrass prairie or savannah. Texas live oak trees and mottes are widely scattered, but make up less than 5 percent canopy. Little bluestem is the dominant plant on the site. Big bluestem and Indiangrass occupy favorable micro-sites and can be locally prominent. Also occurring on the site but less frequently or in smaller amounts are sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), feather bluestem (Bothriochloa spp.), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), and other grasses. Many forbs are endemic to the site adding color to the landscape and providing variety to the diet of the animal community. The mixture of animals using the site will change the plant composition. Overgrazing the plant community with cattle will lead to a reduction in little bluestem, big bluestem, and Indiangrass. If the site is heavily stocked with multiple species such as cattle, sheep, goats, and wildlife the site will shift toward a plant community with very little herbaceous cover and woody trees leaving shrubs with browse lines. Research indicates juniper can establish on both overgrazed and properly grazed rangeland on this site unless goats and probably sheep are utilized (Taylor, 1997; Anderson, et al., 2013). Wildlife species are a vector in spreading the seeds through droppings. Evidence of this is observed along fence lines and under trees. Without fire on a return interval of 3 to 5 years or with managed goat grazing, the site will cross a threshold of 5 to 10 percent canopy to a Prairie Shrubland Community (2.1) in as little as 5 to 8 years. In order to implement prescribed burning, prescribed grazing is essential. This plant community can have approximately 3,800 pounds per acre of fine fuels (1 hour) accumulation with long periods of no grazing because of carryover vegetation.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on gravelly clay loam soils on steep slopes. The reference vegetation includes a savannah of live oak and Texas red oak with midgrasses, tallgrasses, forbs and few shrubs. Without periodic fire or other brush management, juniper and other woody species will likely increase across the site.

Soil Features
The representative soils of this site are very shallow, shallow, and moderately deep, usually gravelly, light-colored loam and clay loam over soft limestone. Because of slope, runoff is rapid even under good plant cover. In the absence of plant cover and residues, the soils crust readily. The soil formed in residuum over interbedded limestone and marl. These soils are strongly calcareous and have low water holding capacity. For these reasons, the site is droughty. Forage grown on this site is usually low in plant nutrients, especially phosphorus. In a representative profile, the surface layer is a pale brown gravelly clay loam ranging from 0 to 15 inches in depth. The substratum in the Kerrville Series is 15 to 24 inches of marl with indurated limestone bedrock at 24 to 30 inches. In the Real and Brackett Series, the substratum ranges from 13 to 60 inches of interbedded marl. In these two series, after 20 inches, the potential for hitting indurated limestone bedrock increases with depth. Most map units contain slopes that are convex and range from 8 percent to 30 percent slopes on Steep Adobe sites. Kerrville and Brackett soils may range from 20 percent to 60 percent. Horizontal outcrops of limestone give the slopes a stair-stepped or benched appearance. Angular limestone pebbles and cobbles are on the surface of some areas. Sites with less than 20 percent slopes are more accessible to vehicle and livestock traffic. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site.

Reference Community
The Mid-Tallgrass Savannah (1.1) will be the reference community as it is perceived to have been the most extensive community. The data for this community is derived from old range site descriptions, professional consensus, and professional interpretation of collected data. This community is composed of mid and tall grasses plus scattered live oaks, Texas oaks, shrubs, forbs, and juniper. Percent canopy for this site is variable depending on the geologic formations which influence vegetation types. The overstory canopy may average about 20 percent for the site, with isolated areas being very dense and others being very open. Common woody species will be live oak, Texas oak, Ashe juniper, Bigelow oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba), sumac walnut (Juglans spp.), madrone, and several associated species. Tall and mid grasses dominate the open areas throughout the site while far less herbaceous cover may exist in the shrub and tree community. Because of slope direction and exposure, woody species will vary. For example, Lacey (Quercus laceyi), Bigelow oak, and Ashe juniper are found more on the north facing slopes while the drier shrubland or thinner woody species occurs on the south facing slopes. Some seeps or spring flow would be present to add to the mosaic pattern of the site. Periodic fires and limited grazing by bison and other herbivores were natural processes that maintained this mosaic plant community. When species such as little bluestem, Indiangrass, sideoats grama, and Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia) are grazed out of the plant community, herbaceous species are replaced by Wright's threeawn (Aristida wrightii), canyon and seep muhly, and Ashe juniper. If heavy grazing continues for many years, retrogression of the plant community will occur and species such as Ashe juniper and other low succession species will increase. With no brush control and continued overgrazing, all palatable plants will disappear and juniper and oaks will dominate the site. It should be noted that Ashe juniper will also increase independently of grazing as its seeds are spread by birds and other animals. Ashe juniper (which originally occurred as a mosaic along more protected rocky, craggy outcrops on the steeper portions of the side where it was protected from historic fires) may increase to form a dense canopy and will suppress other vegetation. Soil, plant, and watershed health indicators are negatively impacted when the site is allowed to deteriorate. The integrity of the Reference Plant Community can be maintained with a few management practices. Brush control, proper stocking rates, and deferments can allow the site to respond positively relative to plant and soil health. Hand cutting of juniper and/or prescribed burning are examples of viable practices for the flatter slopes of this site. Individual Plant Treatment (IPT) alternatives are other options which may be effective. The Reference Plant community is a stable community with sunlight energy cycling through several functional groups such as warm season grasses, cool season grasses, trees, and shrubs. Erosion does occur naturally along steeper drains but for the most part, the site is stable.

Ecological Site Concept
The Redlands Ecological Site has non-calcareous soils over limestone. The reference vegetation is an oak savannah with mid and tallgrasses, forbs and few shrubs. Without periodic fire or brush management, woody species will likely increase and dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Redland ecological site, the soils are shallow, brown or reddish brown, fertile clays, and clay loams. They are underlain by slightly fractured indurated limestone bedrock at depths of 20 inches or less. Plant roots penetrate the crevices, which are usually filled with reddish brown clay. Limestone fragments, cherts, cobbles and stones sometimes occur on the surface and may make up as much as 25 percent of the soil by volume. When dry, the soils crack and take in water rapidly. When wet, the cracks close, and the soils become sticky and plastic and take in water slowly. Light showers are ineffective on the site, which favors the growth of deep-rooted perennial plants. When plant residues are inadequate, soil condition deteriorates and heavy surface crusts develop. In this condition water intake is very slow, runoff is rapid, erosion is a hazard, and grass recovery is slow. The stones on the surface reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The mineral content and reaction of these soils enable the site to produce highly nutritious forage. In association with other sites, Redland is usually the preferred grazing area. These sites occur on more stable hillslopes on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative map units associated with the Redland ecological site are: Hensley association, undulating Tarpley association, undulating

Reference Community
The Oak Savannah Community (1.1) is the interpretive plant community. This plant community is a fire/grazing managed savannah composed of tall grasses. The overstory shades around10 percent of the site and consists primarily of post oak, but may include Bigelow oak (Quercus buckleyi), Texas red oak (Quercus texana), Texas live oak, blackjack oak and several associated species. The post oak and blackjack oak are signature key indicators of the Redland site. Occasionally however there may only be Texas live oak. The role of historic fire and bison grazing was to keep sunlight energy flowing through the deep-rooted trees and grasses, accelerate the mineral and nutrient cycle and to capture the optimum amount of rainfall. The removal or alteration of these ecological disturbances will trigger the plant community to change. The total removal of grazing animals may, in fact, accelerate this change. Juniper is added to the site via droppings from perching birds and small mammals that eat the seeds. Ashe juniper, which is a nonsprouting woody plant easily controlled by fire, and other woody species will increase without fire or some form of brush management. Once Ashe juniper encroachments it can easily be controlled with prescribed fire. When the juniper exceeds about 6 feet in height, fire options become limited. Without intervention, the Ashe juniper will continue to increase and move towards the Oak/Juniper Grassland plant community (1.2). This may occur in as little as five years.

Reference Community
The data for this community is derived from field data collections and professional consensus. This site is a fire managed, open grassland with scattered oak mottes with about 10 to 20 percent tree canopy. The live oak is most abundant along watercourses, where elm (Ulmus spp.) and hackberry (Celtis spp.) trees also grow. Under a fire regime, the live oak can exist both as a tree and as a mott or thicket as it is a vigorous root sprouter. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants, and may even dominate locally. Also native to the site, but occurring less frequency or in lesser amounts are the wildryes (Elymus spp.), Sideoats grama, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), feathery bluestems (Bothriochloa spp.), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). The site also grows an abundance of forbs, shrubs and woody vines. Overstocking and thus overgrazing by domesticated animals can cause a decline and even the elimination of numerous plants from this community. As the plant community degenerates, big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, and the wildryes decrease. Sideoats grama, tall dropseed, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) are initial increasers on the site. Prolonged overuse of these plants usually results in a community of Texas wintergrass, curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri), buffalograss, and woody species.

Ecological Site Concept
The Deep Redlands have non-calcareous soils over limestone with a depth greater than 2- inches. Surface fragments 3 inches in size are less than 20 percent. The reference vegetation includes an oak savannah dominated by tallgrasses and post oaks, along with numerous forbs and other oak species. Without fire or brush management, junipers and other woody species will likely increase on the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Deep Redland ecological site, the soils are reddish brown, moderately deep, non-calcareous clays, clay loams or loams. They are underlain by slightly fractured indurated limestone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Plant roots penetrate the crevices, which are usually filled with reddish brown clay. Limestone fragments, cherts, cobbles and stones sometimes occur on the surface and may make up as much as 15 percent of the soil by volume. When dry, the soils crack and take in water rapidly. When wet, the cracks close, and the soils become sticky and plastic and take in water very slowly. Light showers are ineffective on the site, which favors the growth of deep-rooted perennial plants. When plant residues are inadequate, soil condition deteriorates and heavy surface crusts develop. In this condition water intake is very slow, runoff is rapid, erosion is a hazard, and grass recovery is slow. The mineral content and reaction of these soils enable the site to produce highly nutritious forage. In association with other sites, Deep Redland is usually the preferred grazing area. These sites occur on more stable hillslopes on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to insure the soils are correct for the site. The representative soils associated with the Deep Redland ecological site are Anhalt, Crawford, and Spires. These are the representative map units associated with the Deep Redland ecological site: Anhalt clay, 0 to 2 percent slopes Crawford and Bexar stony soils Spires association, gently undulating

Reference Community
The Oak Savannah Community (1.1) is the interpretive plant community for this. The historic plant community is a fire/grazing climax savannah composed of tall grasses. The overstory shades 10 to 20 percent of the site and consists primarily of post oak, but may include Bigelow oak (Quercus buckleyi), Texas red oak (Quercus texana), Texas live oak (Quercus fusiformis), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and several associated species. The post oak and blackjack oak are signature key indicators of the Deep Redland site. Occasionally however there may only be Texas live oak. The role of fire and grazing was to keep sunlight energy flowing through the deep-rooted trees and grasses, accelerate the mineral and nutrient cycle and to capture the optimum amount of rainfall. The removal or alteration of these ecological disturbances can trigger the plant community to change. The total removal of grazing animals may, in fact, accelerate this change. Juniper is added to the site via droppings from perching birds and small mammals that eat the seeds. Ashe juniper, which is a non-sprouting woody plant easily controlled by fire, and other woody species will increase without fire or some form of brush management. Once Ashe juniper encroachment can be easily controlled with prescribed fire until the plants reach exceeds about 6 feet in height, fire options become limited. Without intervention, the Ashe juniper will continue to increase and move towards the Oak/Juniper Grassland plant community. This may occur in as little as five years.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on moderately deep to deep clay loam soils over limestone. The reference vegetation on these upland sites consists of tallgrasses, numerous forbs, few shrubs and scattered live oak mottes. Without fire or brush management, woody species are likely to increase across the site. Grazing management is key to maintain the reference vegetation.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Clay Loam ecological site, the soils of this site are dark grayish brown, moderately deep to very deep clays or clay loams. Limestone fragments and rocks sometimes occur in the profile or outcrop on the soil surface, but not to the extent that they impair the production of native vegetation. Plant-soil moisture relationships are good. In healthy condition, rills, gullies, wind-scoured areas, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. It should be noted that there may be inclusions of other soils that because of mapping scale are not divided out. These may include some shallow soils with sporadic surface limestone fragments typical of the Eckrant series. The following representative soils associated with the Clay Loam ecological site are Bolar, Krum, and Pratley.

Reference Community
This is the reference or interpretive community for the site. The description is based on early range site descriptions, clipping data, the professional consensus of experienced range specialists, and analysis of field work. In reference condition, this site is a fire/herbivory managed, tallgrass savannah with about 10 percent woody canopy cover. Elm and hackberry trees occur along small streams, and Texas live oak trees or motts are widely scattered. Texas live oak can exist as both a tree and as a mott depending upon fire frequency or other disturbance as it is a vigorous root sprouter. Some juniper may occur depending upon the last fire or removal. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous plant community. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants and may be locally dominant. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass occurred in small quantities. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), silver (Bothriochloa saccharoides), and pinhole bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis var. perforata), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and tall/meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are also prevalent but in lesser amounts. The site grows an abundance of palatable forbs and legumes such as Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), velvet bundleflower (Desmanthus velutinus), and trailing wildbean (Strophostyles helvola). This plant community is very stable and can withstand short term droughts although production will fluctuate accordingly. If the site is abused by overgrazing of the site with cattle, a reduction of the more palatable tall and mid grasses, forbs, and legumes will occur. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver and pinhole bluestem, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) will increase. Texas wintergrass, along with a small amount of wildryes (Elymus spp.), often dominates the site and furnishes considerable cool-season forage. The cool season plants will also be more prominent when abundant fall rains occur. Fire on a 5- to 10-year frequency will help suppress shrubs and add to the cycling of minerals and nutrients. Fires prevent excessive buildup of litter. Research on the effects of fire on soil organisms reveal complex results and are ecosystem dependent. Soil fauna may decrease following a burn if the burn leaves the soil bare and not insulated (Wright, 1982). It is anticipated that a burn on this site, leaving some litter on the soil, may initially depress soil fauna but then experience an increase following a burn mainly because the sun warms the ground quicker. This leads to more rapid nutrient cycling and increased production and quality. In general, if burning follows historic fire return intervals, the litter and soil fauna will be sustainable (Scifres, 1980). Grazing has a dual effect in maintaining this grassland. Grazing assists in nutrient cycling by digesting coarse grasses and depositing the digested plants through manure back to the soil surface. However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

In a representative profile for the Low Stony Hill ecological site, these soils are very shallow or shallow to indurated limestone. Depth of bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches. The soil is a black clayey soil and is neutral to alkaline. Subrounded to angular pebbles, cobbles, and stones of limestone comprise 35 to 70 percent by volume of the soil. Surface fragments reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The soils are fertile, usually have good structure, and take in water readily. Their fertility and moisture-holding capacity, however, is limited by soil depth and fragment volume. Fractures in the limestone bedrock, on the other hand, generally contain fine soil particles and store moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. Forage produced on the site is of good quality. These sites occur on interfluves and sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative soil associated with the Low Stony Hill ecological site is Eckrant. These are the representative map units associated with the Low Stony Hill ecological site: Eckrant association, undulating Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes Eckrant-Comfort association, gently undulating Eckrant-Rock outcrop association, undulating

Reference Community
The data for this community is derived from field data collections and professional consensus. This site is a fire managed, open grassland with scattered oak mottes with about 10 to 20 percent tree canopy. The live oak is most abundant along watercourses, where elm (Ulmus spp.) and hackberry (Celtis spp.) trees also grow. Under a fire regime, the live oak can exist both as a tree and as a mott or thicket as it is a vigorous root sprouter. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants, and may even dominate locally. Also native to the site, but occurring less frequency or in lesser amounts are the wildryes (Elymus spp.), Sideoats grama, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), feathery bluestems (Bothriochloa spp.), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). The site also grows an abundance of forbs, shrubs and woody vines. Overstocking and thus overgrazing by domesticated animals can cause a decline and even the elimination of numerous plants from this community. As the plant community degenerates, big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, and the wildryes decrease. Sideoats grama, tall dropseed, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) are initial increasers on the site. Prolonged overuse of these plants usually results in a community of Texas wintergrass, curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri), buffalograss, and woody species. The following grasses and forbs are commonly found on this site in a deteriorated condition: Western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), Broomweed (Amphiachyris spp.), prairie coneflower (Ratibida columnifera), Snow-on-the-Mountain (Euphorbia marginata), silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), Leavenworth eryngo (Eryngium leavenworthii), twin-leaf senna (Cassia roemariana), gray goldaster (Heterotheca canescens), horehound (Marrabium vulgare), evax (Evax spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), red grama (Bouteloua trifida), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus panniculatus), windmillgrasses (Chloris spp.), and annual brome grasses (Bromus spp.).

Ecological Site Concept
Lakebeds are shallow depressions that support moist soil plant communities. They stay inundated after heavy rainfall events.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well to somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable to impermeable that formed in clayey alluvium. Although horizons may differ in surface textures, all have nearly impermeable subsoils that pond water. Soils correlated to this site include: Papagua, Realitos, and Tiocano.

Reference Community
Because of a lack of reference communities, the interpretive information for this plant community is derived from previously developed range site descriptions and professional consensus of range trained field staff. This grassland community develops when soils in the shallow depressions of the Sandsheet Prairie maintain a degree of wetness because of periodic rainfall events. Mid/tallgrasses thrive on this ecological site and will follow the waterline as water evaporates out of the ponded areas. Hartweg's paspalum (Paspalum hartwegianum) represents a significant proportion of the plant. The forb community will vary based on rainfall and fluctuations in the ponded status of the depression, but commonly include Texas frog fruit (Phyla nodiflora) and wood sorrel (Oxalis spp.). Areas of bare ground that are exposed by water evaporation during the fall and winter will typically have more forbs than if the bare ground is exposed during the spring and summer, which will favor grass species. Rattlebush (Sesbania drummondii) is a common shrub that will make up a trace amount of the plant composition. The duration of time this ecological site has standing water is highly variable and driven by local weather patterns.

The Tight Sandy Loam ecological sites typically have fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam surface textures. Tight refers to the sandy clay or clay subsoil that begins about 10 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained, moderately slowly to very slowly permeable, and strongly acid to slightly alkaline. A typical pedon will exhibit an ochric epipedon, an argillic horizon beginning at 10 inches and depth to secondary carbonates ranging from 28 to 40 inches.

Soils correlated to this site include: Ander, Batesville, Bryde, Czar, Floresville, Gillett, Griter, Miguel, Papalote, and Webb.

Reference Community
The representative plant Community for this ecological site is a diverse Midgrass Community (1.1) with less than five percent woody plant cover. Dominant grasses are two to four feet in tall. Bare ground is minimal. Little bluestem is prevalent in the eastern portion of the MLRA. Multiflower Rhodesgrass, false Rhodesgrass, and Arizona cottontop are more abundant in the drier western part of the MLRA. Subdominant grass species are feathery bluestem and pink pappusgrass. Most common woody species are mesquite, snakewood, and spiny hackberry. The woody species are typically small and obscured by grasses. The majority of production occurs in late spring and early summer when temperatures and moisture are typically most suitable for growth. As conditions become warmer and drier, grasses become dormant and substantial litter accumulation occurs, making the site prone to fire. Recurrent fire (every three to five years) favors persistence of the dominant grasses and keeps the cover of woody plants low. In years without fire, leaf litter decomposes and adds organic matter to the soil, thus enhancing its fertility and water holding capacity. The dominant grasses are also highly productive belowground and are relatively deeply rooted. Extensive root systems bind the soil to minimize erosion while enabling the dominant grasses to access stored soil moisture, thus stabilizing aboveground production. With their high ground cover and large root systems, the dominant grasses tend to monopolize light, water, nutrients, and competitively exclude other plants.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 12 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils in this site are moderately deep to very deep, well drained with moderate to moderately slow permeability. The surface horizon is typically 12 inches with a fine sandy loam texture over a sandy clay loam subsoil. Soils correlated to this site include: Brystal, Colmena, Duval, Goliad, Jourdanton, Premont, Raisin, Runge, Weesatche, Whitsett, and Willacy.

Reference Community
The reference plant community for this ecological site is a Midgrass Dominant Grassland Community (1.1) with less than five percent woody plant cover. Dominant grasses are two to four feet tall and bare ground is minimal. Little bluestem is prevalent in the eastern portion of the region with four-flower trichloris and Arizona cottontop becoming more abundant in the drier western region. Woody plants, when present, consist primarily of mesquite, but may also include various acacia species. They would be small and obscured by grasses. The majority of production occurs in late spring and early summer when temperatures and moisture are typically most suitable for growth. As conditions become warmer and drier, grasses become dormant and substantial litter accumulation occurs, making the site prone to fire. Recurrent fire, every 5 to 10 years, favors persistence of the dominant grasses and keeps the cover of woody plants low. In years without fire, leaf litter decomposes and adds organic matter to the soil, thus enhancing its fertility and water holding capacity. The dominant grasses are also highly productive belowground and are relatively deeply rooted. Extensive root systems bind the soil to minimize erosion while enabling the dominant grasses to access stored soil moisture, thus stabilizing aboveground production. With their high ground cover and large root systems, the dominant grasses tend to monopolize light, water, and nutrients and competitively exclude other plants.

Soil Features
The soils in this site are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon or tuffaceous sandstone interbedded with claystone. They are well drained with moderate to very slow permeability. Surface textures are fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay with or without gravels. Soils correlated to this site include: Condido, Olemedo, Olmos, Pavelek, and Picosa.

Reference Community
This community represents the reference plant community. Fire did not play as important a role on this site as on deeper more productive sites. Guajillo dominates a wide variety of woody shrubs. The predominant grasses for this site are sideoats grama, little bluestem, bristlegrass species, and Arizona cottontop. Arizona cottontop and plains bristlegrass (Setaria macrostachya) are the more opportunistic species on this site. While grazing was a natural component of the ecosystem, overstocking and continuous overgrazing has a strong impact on this site. Due to overgrazing the midgrasses such as sideoats grama and bristlegrass species decrease. Such grasses as slim tridens and threeawn species are the major increasers. On the central and western range of the MLRA, sideoats grama may be the more dominant decreaser species.

Reference Community
The representative plant Community for this ecological site is a diverse Midgrass Community (1.1) with less than five percent woody plant cover. Dominant grasses are two to four feet in tall. Bare ground is minimal. Little bluestem is prevalent in the eastern portion of the MLRA. Multiflower Rhodesgrass, false Rhodesgrass, and Arizona cottontop are more abundant in the drier western part of the MLRA. Subdominant grass species are feathery bluestem and pink pappusgrass. Most common woody species are mesquite, snakewood, and spiny hackberry. The woody species are typically small and obscured by grasses. The majority of production occurs in late spring and early summer when temperatures and moisture are typically most suitable for growth. As conditions become warmer and drier, grasses become dormant and substantial litter accumulation occurs, making the site prone to fire. Recurrent fire (every three to five years) favors persistence of the dominant grasses and keeps the cover of woody plants low. In years without fire, leaf litter decomposes and adds organic matter to the soil, thus enhancing its fertility and water holding capacity. The dominant grasses are also highly productive belowground and are relatively deeply rooted. Extensive root systems bind the soil to minimize erosion while enabling the dominant grasses to access stored soil moisture, thus stabilizing aboveground production. With their high ground cover and large root systems, the dominant grasses tend to monopolize light, water, nutrients, and competitively exclude other plants.

Ecological Site Concept
The Shallow Ridge ecological sites are located on uplands. They are shallow to bedrock or a petrocalcic horizon. Petrocalcic horizons are strongly cemented layers of calcium carbonate. Some of the soils have gravels in the soil profile.

Soil Features
The soils in this site are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon or tuffaceous sandstone interbedded with claystone. They are well drained with moderate to very slow permeability. Surface textures are fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay with or without gravels. Soils correlated to this site include: Condido, Olemedo, Olmos, Pavelek, and Picosa.

Reference Community
This community represents the reference plant community. Fire did not play as important a role on this site as on deeper more productive sites. Guajillo dominates a wide variety of woody shrubs. The predominant grasses for this site are sideoats grama, little bluestem, bristlegrass species, and Arizona cottontop. Arizona cottontop and plains bristlegrass (Setaria macrostachya) are the more opportunistic species on this site. While grazing was a natural component of the ecosystem, overstocking and continuous overgrazing has a strong impact on this site. Due to overgrazing the midgrasses such as sideoats grama and bristlegrass species decrease. Such grasses as slim tridens and threeawn species are the major increasers. On the central and western range of the MLRA, sideoats grama may be the more dominant decreaser species. On the more northern and eastern ranges of the MLRA, the same site maybe dominated by little bluestem.

Ecological Site Concept
The Sandy Loam ecological site typically has a fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam surface. Sandy clay loam subsoil horizons are generally present 12 inches below the surface. The reference plant community was a grassland with some woody species. 

Soil Features
The soils are deep to very deep, well drained, and slow to moderately slowly permeable. The surface texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam. The soils were formed in from alluvium. Soil correlate to this site include: Brennan, Brystal, and Duval. 

Reference Community
This community was maintained by periodic grazing by wild populations and numerous fires; both natural and anthropogenic. Fire frequency is perceived to be variable and only to occur in above average years followed by drought and/or prolonged dormant periods. The site is productive and maintained a high percentage of ground cover most of the time. During extended droughts, this ground cover of perennial grasses and forbs was often greatly reduced but had the resiliency to recover when favorable climatic conditions returned. Runoff of rainfall was medium with good ground cover but could be quite high following episodic grazing events, fire, or extended drought. The soils of this site are capable of capping when denuded and in this condition shed most of the rainfall making the site slow to recover. Tanglehead (Heteropogon contortus) is perceived to have made up to 20 to 30 percent of the grass production with several midgrasses also occurring at various levels. Plains bristlegrass (Setaria vulpiseta), Rio Grande bristlegrass (Setaria reverchonii), hooded windmillgrass (Chloris cucullata), pink pappusgrass (Pappophorum bicolor), whiplash pappusgrass (Pappophorum vaginatum), Arizona cottontop (Digitaria californica), and longspike beardgrass (Bothriochloa longipaniculata) are all perceived to have been common on the site as well. A wide variety of forbs and legumes grow well on this site when conditions are favorable. Some forbs such as prairie acacia (Acacia angustissima), orange zexmenia (Wedelia texana), and cuman ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya) are present in lesser amounts. The major woody plants were scattered mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) along with smaller amounts of mixed brush throughout the site. While periodic grazing was a natural component of the ecosystem, continuous abusive grazing has a strong negative impact on this site. Because of abusive grazing, the midgrasses decrease and are replaced by less palatable and short-lived grasses. Droughts hasten the process. Major grass increasers are slim tridens (Tridens muticus), southern witchgrass (Panicum capillare), fringed signalgrass (Urochloa ciliatissima), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), slender grama (Bouteloua repens), tumble lovegrass (Eragrostis sessiispica), and fall witchgrass (Digitaria cognata). A significant role for prescribed grazing is to build and maintain fine fuel amounts for effective prescribed burning.

Reference Community
The Mixed-grass Savannah Community (1.1) is the reference community and is characterized as a hardwood savannah with up to 20 percent tree and shrub canopy cover. Historic records from the 1700's indicate that early settlers and explorers found portions of this site to be heavily wooded. Other reports (Mann 2004) discuss the importance of human caused fire as an important factor in keeping open grasslands prior to European settlement. It is assumed the Mixed-grass Savannah Community (1.1) occurred over the majority of this ecological site in a dynamically shifting mosaic over time with the other two communities in the Savannah State. Little bluestem, Virginia wildrye, Canada wildrye, sedges, switchgrass, Indiangrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) dominate the herbaceous component of the site. Forbs commonly found on the site include tickclover (Desmodium spp.), wildbeans (Strophostyles spp.), lespedezas (Lespedeza spp.), and partridge pea (Chamaecrista fasciculata). Shrub and tree species found in the Mixed-grass Savannah Community (1.1) include species of oaks, pecan, hackberry (Celtis spp.), and elm (Ulmus spp.). Vines include greenbrier (Smilax spp.), grape (Vitis spp.), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), and peppervine (Ampelopsis spp.). The reference savannah community will shift to the Midgrass Savannah Community (1.2) under the stresses of improper grazing. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable grasses and forbs. This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and paspalums. If improper grazing continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus), and Vasey's grass (Paspalum urvillei). Less palatable forbs will also increase at this stage. Without fire and/or brush control, woody species on the site will increase and transition the site to the Woodland State (2). This can occur with or without the understory transitioning to the Midgrass community. This transition can occur without degradation of the herbaceous community from dominance by tallgrasses and palatable midgrasses to dominance by midgrasses. Brown and Archer (1999) concluded that even with a healthy and dense stand of grasses, woody species will populate the site and eventually dominate the community. Because the dominant woody species in the Woodland State are native species that occur as part of the Savannah State, the transition to the Woodland State is a linear process, with shrubs increasing soon after fire or brush control ceases. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 50 percent canopy cover that indicates a state change. This is a continual process. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 50 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Woodland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Woodland State. The soils of this site are deep, loamy textured, and moderately permeable. The site generally receives additional water from outside the site. Infiltration is moderate and runoff is low. There is essentially no bare soil in this community. Plant basal cover and litter comprise all of the ground cover. Soils are highly fertile and hold moderately large amounts of soil moisture. This is a very productive site with high yields of good quality forage.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Bottomlands have soils that are very deep loams and are associated with flooding regimes. The loamy-textured soils allow the water to drain faster than the Clayey Bottomlands, and therefore do not stay inundated as long.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are very deep, loamy textured, and moderately permeable. They usually receive extra water as overflow from watercourses or as runoff from adjacent higher sites. They are, however, better drained than the Clayey Bottomland sites. The plant-soil- water-air relationship is very favorable for plant growth. These factors, together with the natural fertility of the soil, favor high yields of good quality forage. Soils correlated to the site include: Coarsewood, Degola, Highbank, Navidad, Pursley, Uhland, Warda, Weswood, Whitesboro, and Yahola. 

Reference Community
The reference plant community of this site is a savannah. Oak, elm, hackberry, cottonwood, ash, black willow (Salix nigra), pecan, and other large trees provide about a 20 percent canopy. The overstory canopy is denser immediately adjacent to the watercourse. The understory may include hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), Alabama supplejack (Berchemia scandens), peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), grape (Vitis spp.), trumpet creeper (Parthenocissus spp.), and honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica). Sedges, Virginia wildrye, switchcane, broadleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium latifolium), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) in shaded and wet areas dominate the herbaceous plant community. Various combinations of beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern gamagrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum) may dominate drier, open areas. Continuous yearlong grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the reference herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of common Bermudagrass, dallisgrass, Vasey's grass (Paspalum urvillei), carpetgrass, giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and annual sumpweed (Iva annua). Prescribed grazing may shift this herbaceous community back towards the reference herbaceous species. Continuous yearlong grazing with no weed or brush management or abandoning the site for several years will tend to move towards a shrub-sapling community. Once woody shrubs and saplings invade the site, brush management in some form must be used to move back toward the Savannah State. Prescribed burning is not a viable management tool on this site due to excess fine fuel moisture.

Ecological Site Concept
The Shallow Ridge ecological sites are located on uplands. They are shallow to bedrock or a petrocalcic horizon. Petrocalcic horizons are strongly cemented layers of calcium carbonate. Some of the soils have gravels in the soil profile.

Soil Features
The soils in this site are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon or tuffaceous sandstone interbedded with claystone. They are well drained with moderate to very slow permeability. Surface textures are fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay with or without gravels. Soils correlated to this site include: Condido, Olemedo, Olmos, Pavelek, and Picosa.

Reference Community
This community represents the reference plant community. Fire did not play as important a role on this site as on deeper more productive sites. Guajillo dominates a wide variety of woody shrubs. The predominant grasses for this site are sideoats grama, little bluestem, bristlegrass species, and Arizona cottontop. Arizona cottontop and plains bristlegrass (Setaria macrostachya) are the more opportunistic species on this site. While grazing was a natural component of the ecosystem, overstocking and continuous overgrazing has a strong impact on this site. Due to overgrazing the midgrasses such as sideoats grama and bristlegrass species decrease. Such grasses as slim tridens and threeawn species are the major increasers. On the central and western range of the MLRA, sideoats grama may be the more dominant decreaser species. On the more northern and eastern ranges of the MLRA, the same site maybe dominated by little bluestem.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Ecological Site Concept
The Eroded Blackland ecological site is a tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show intact communites of grasses with pockets of woody species interspersed. Biomass productivity is not as high as the Blackland site due to the erosion that has partially, or completely, removed the A horizon.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, well drained soils that are slow to very permeable. These soils formed in weakly consolidated calcareous marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. As such, these soils are comprised of thin clayey surface layers and subsoils depending on the severity of their erosion. Erosion on the site occurs as gently sloping to rolling upland ridges. Uncultivated areas often have narrow microridges and microvalleys that extend up and down the slope. In a representative profile the surface layer is dark grayish brown or very dark gray clay about 32 inches thick. The subsoil is grayish brown or light yellowish brown clay. These soils formed in calcareous clayey shale. The available water capacity is low to moderate. Infiltration is rapid when the soil is dry and cracked, but very slow when the soil is wet. The dominant associated soil series for the Eroded Blackland include: Engle, Ellis, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, Sumter, and Vertel.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) mosaic includes deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses. Warm-season, perennial midgrasses constitute most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season perennial forb component varies from 5 to 15 percent of the community composition depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community even in the absence of fire (at least 25 to 50 years). Midgrasses dominate the shallower ""eroded"" areas. The eroded area, from which the site derives its name, resulted from prehistoric loss of the A horizon. These areas form a mosaic with deeper soils and may range in size from less than 200 to over 1,000 square feet. These areas often appear to be associated with prehistoric water courses. They appear to be associated more with water erosion than with wind erosion, but are probably a result of a combination of both. Little bluestem dominates the site, while other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, switchgrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and Texas wintergrass. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), and halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus). Typical, but infrequent shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens), hackberry, elm, and live oak. The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (Indiangrass, big bluestem, Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem, which will increase its dominance. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent of the ground cover.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Ecological Site Concept
The Eroded Blackland ecological site is a tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show intact communites of grasses with pockets of woody species interspersed. Biomass productivity is not as high as the Blackland site due to the erosion that has partially, or completely, removed the A horizon.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, well drained soils that are slow to very permeable. These soils formed in weakly consolidated calcareous marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. As such, these soils are comprised of thin clayey surface layers and subsoils depending on the severity of their erosion. Erosion on the site occurs as gently sloping to rolling upland ridges. Uncultivated areas often have narrow microridges and microvalleys that extend up and down the slope. In a representative profile the surface layer is dark grayish brown or very dark gray clay about 32 inches thick. The subsoil is grayish brown or light yellowish brown clay. These soils formed in calcareous clayey shale. The available water capacity is low to moderate. Infiltration is rapid when the soil is dry and cracked, but very slow when the soil is wet. The dominant associated soil series for the Eroded Blackland include: Engle, Ellis, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, Sumter, and Vertel.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) mosaic includes deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses. Warm-season, perennial midgrasses constitute most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season perennial forb component varies from 5 to 15 percent of the community composition depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community even in the absence of fire (at least 25 to 50 years). Midgrasses dominate the shallower ""eroded"" areas. The eroded area, from which the site derives its name, resulted from prehistoric loss of the A horizon. These areas form a mosaic with deeper soils and may range in size from less than 200 to over 1,000 square feet. These areas often appear to be associated with prehistoric water courses. They appear to be associated more with water erosion than with wind erosion, but are probably a result of a combination of both. Little bluestem dominates the site, while other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, switchgrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and Texas wintergrass. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), and halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus). Typical, but infrequent shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens), hackberry, elm, and live oak. The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (Indiangrass, big bluestem, Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem, which will increase its dominance. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent of the ground cover.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a true tallgrass prairie. The soils are characterized by loamy surface soils underlain by dense, hard, clays. This inchesclaypaninches restricts air and water movements, as well as root penetration.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to deep, moderately well to well drained soils that have slow to very slow permeability. The upland soils formed in calcareous weathered shale and the terraces formed in clayey alluvial sediments. In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark brown fine sandy loam about eight inches thick. Below 8 inches and to depths of more than 40 inches, the subsoil is clay that grades from brown to olive as depth increases. The subsoil commonly contains pale yellow and light brownish gray mottles as well as calcium carbonate masses. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate and the shrink-swell potential can be a limitation. The Claypan Prairie soils can be highly productive for improved pasture or rangeland however, when dry, the surface layer of these soils can be massive and hard. The site is used primarily for improved pasture or rangeland, however, a few small areas are used for cropland. The dominant associated soil series include: Bazette, Bremond, Crockett, Davilla, Ivanhoe, Mabank, Navo, Normangee, Parisian, Payne, Ponder, Rader, and Wilson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils underlain at rather shallow depths by dense, hard, clayey material. This ""claypan"" restricts air and water movements, as well as root penetration. This site is dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent or less. Little bluestem dominates the site. Indiangrass, big bluestem, and switchgrass act as decreasers on this site and are the first species to be removed by improper grazing management. Other important grasses include Virginia wildrye, Canada wildrye (Elymus Canadensis), and Florida paspalum. Important midgrasses include sideoats grama, hairy dropseed (Sporobolus compositus var. drummondii), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), and Texas wintergrass. Forbs commonly found on the site include: Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), scurfpea (Psoralidium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), hackberry, coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus), and bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g., switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Forbs, particularly less palatable species, will increase at this stage. This site can have dramatic increases in forbs, particularly following a fire. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is moderate and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. However, once soils have sealed shut, infiltration is slow and runoff may be rapid. Soils are high in organic matter and the heavy plant cover contributes to increasing organic matter and soil building.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition.

The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Ecological Site Concept
The Eroded Blackland ecological site is a tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show intact communites of grasses with pockets of woody species interspersed. Biomass productivity is not as high as the Blackland site due to the erosion that has partially, or completely, removed the A horizon.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, well drained soils that are slow to very permeable. These soils formed in weakly consolidated calcareous marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. As such, these soils are comprised of thin clayey surface layers and subsoils depending on the severity of their erosion. Erosion on the site occurs as gently sloping to rolling upland ridges. Uncultivated areas often have narrow microridges and microvalleys that extend up and down the slope. In a representative profile the surface layer is dark grayish brown or very dark gray clay about 32 inches thick. The subsoil is grayish brown or light yellowish brown clay. These soils formed in calcareous clayey shale. The available water capacity is low to moderate. Infiltration is rapid when the soil is dry and cracked, but very slow when the soil is wet. The dominant associated soil series for the Eroded Blackland include: Engle, Ellis, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, Sumter, and Vertel.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) mosaic includes deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses. Warm-season, perennial midgrasses constitute most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season perennial forb component varies from 5 to 15 percent of the community composition depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community even in the absence of fire (at least 25 to 50 years). Midgrasses dominate the shallower ""eroded"" areas. The eroded area, from which the site derives its name, resulted from prehistoric loss of the A horizon. These areas form a mosaic with deeper soils and may range in size from less than 200 to over 1,000 square feet. These areas often appear to be associated with prehistoric water courses. They appear to be associated more with water erosion than with wind erosion, but are probably a result of a combination of both. Little bluestem dominates the site, while other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, switchgrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), and Texas wintergrass. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), and halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus). Typical, but infrequent shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens), hackberry, elm, and live oak. The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (Indiangrass, big bluestem, Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem, which will increase its dominance. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent of the ground cover.

Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years).

Ecological Site Concept
The Clay Loam ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie, dominated by little bluestem. The soils are shallow to deep and characterized by their clay loam texture.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep, well drained soils that have moderate to slow permeability. The the parent material is calcareous alluvium weathered from limestone hills. In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark grayish-brown, calcareous clay loam about 10 to 18 inches thick over a brown calcareous clay loam subsoil. Depth to bedrock ranges from 22 to more than 60 inches below the surface. The available water capacity is low to moderate. The following dominant soil series are: Altoga, Austin, Blum, Bonham, Culp, Cuthand, Howe, Krum, Lamar, Lewisville, Lott, McLennan, Seawillow, Sunev, Venus, and Whiteright. 

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is a true prairie with a few large live oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional mottes. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, 5 percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Little bluestem, Indiangrass, and big bluestem dominate the site. Other important grasses include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), switchgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Florida paspalum. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, hackberry, pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and elm, along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference prairie community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (i.e. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and sideoats grama. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and Texas wintergrass will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Prairie State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect.

It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Reference Community
This Mid/Shortgrass Prairie Community (1.1) developed under natural disturbance regimes spanning thousands of years. Composition of grasses makes up 90 percent of annual production. Late succession plants such as false rhodesgrass, Arizona cottontop (Digitaria californica), and tanglehead make up about 25 percent of this community. Increaser plants, or more resilient species, make up 65 percent. These grasses include plains bristlegrass, pink pappusgrass, silver bluestem, and hooded windmillgrass along with threeawns and other shortgrasses. Perennial forbs, shrubs, and woody species make up the remainder. Annual forbs occur in varying amounts in response to grazing intensity, fire, drought, or excessive precipitation. The occurrence of annual forbs is sporadic and usually short-lived, mostly depending on rainfall events. This community is productive and can be managed to attain many landowner goals for livestock, wildlife, or recreation. The droughty nature of this site increases competition between species for water and nutrients; this tends to promote a high diversity in species composition because no one species can easily dominate the plant community. Rainfall differences across the region will cause subtle changes in plant community and overall productivity, which is displayed as high and low values in the annual production tables.

This community is productive and can be managed to attain many landowner goals for livestock, wildlife, or recreation. The droughty nature of this site increases competition between species for water and nutrients; this tends to promote a high diversity in species composition because no one species can easily dominate the plant community. Rainfall differences across the region will cause subtle changes in plant community and overall productivity, which is displayed as high and low values in the annual production tables.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on very shallow and shallow clay loam soils over indurated limestone bedrock. The reference vegetation includes tall and midgrasses along with numerous forbs and scattered mottes of live oak. Without fire or brush management, juniper and other woody species are likely to increase across the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Low Stony Hill ecological site, these soils are very shallow or shallow to indurated limestone. Depth of bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches. The soil is a black clayey soil and is neutral to alkaline. Subrounded to angular pebbles, cobbles, and stones of limestone comprise 35 to 70 percent by volume of the soil. Surface fragments reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The soils are fertile, usually have good structure, and take in water readily. Their fertility and moisture-holding capacity, however, is limited by soil depth and fragment volume. Fractures in the limestone bedrock, on the other hand, generally contain fine soil particles and store moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. Forage produced on the site is of good quality. These sites occur on interfluves and sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative soil associated with the Low Stony Hill ecological site is Eckrant. These are the representative map units associated with the Low Stony Hill ecological site: Eckrant association, undulating Eckrant cobbly clay, 1 to 8 percent slopes Eckrant-Comfort association, gently undulating Eckrant-Rock outcrop association, undulating

Reference Community
The data for this community is derived from field data collections and professional consensus. This site is a fire managed, open grassland with scattered oak mottes with about 10 to 20 percent tree canopy. The live oak is most abundant along watercourses, where elm (Ulmus spp.) and hackberry (Celtis spp.) trees also grow. Under a fire regime, the live oak can exist both as a tree and as a mott or thicket as it is a vigorous root sprouter. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants, and may even dominate locally. Also native to the site, but occurring less frequency or in lesser amounts are the wildryes (Elymus spp.), Sideoats grama, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), feathery bluestems (Bothriochloa spp.), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). The site also grows an abundance of forbs, shrubs and woody vines. Overstocking and thus overgrazing by domesticated animals can cause a decline and even the elimination of numerous plants from this community. As the plant community degenerates, big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, and the wildryes decrease. Sideoats grama, tall dropseed, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) are initial increasers on the site. Prolonged overuse of these plants usually results in a community of Texas wintergrass, curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri), buffalograss, and woody species. The following grasses and forbs are commonly found on this site in a deteriorated condition: Western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), Broomweed (Amphiachyris spp.), prairie coneflower (Ratibida columnifera), Snow-on-the-Mountain (Euphorbia marginata), silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), Leavenworth eryngo (Eryngium leavenworthii), twin-leaf senna (Cassia roemariana), gray goldaster (Heterotheca canescens), horehound (Marrabium vulgare), evax (Evax spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), red grama (Bouteloua trifida), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus panniculatus), windmillgrasses (Chloris spp.), and annual brome grasses (Bromus spp.).

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on shallow loams and clay loams over limestone bedrock. The reference vegetation consists of an oak savannah including live oak and Texas red oak, with an understory of tall and midgrasses, shrubs and forbs. Without periodic fire or brush management, woody species may increase and dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Adobe ecological site, the soils are shallow to moderately deep, usually gravelly, light-colored loam or clay loam over weakly or moderately cemented limestone with thin beds of indurated limestone. Rock fragments in the surface horizons are about 20 percent and up to 85 percent in the subsoil. There are gravelly to extremely gravelly or paragravelly to extremely paragravelly texture modifiers throughout the soil profile. The permeability of the soil is moderate and the permeability of the paralithic material is very slow to slow. On erosional sideslope positions, the organic matter development in the topsoil is low. Because of high runoff and high calcium carbonate content, the soils are droughty. They do not support a dense cover of plants, which require high amounts of water and plant nutrients. Runoff is rapid, even under good plant cover. Forage grown on the site is usually low in nutritive value and must be supplemented, especially with phosphorus as the high calcium levels tie up the phosphorus. Soils on the lower slopes of the site have organic material in the soil surface and are often characterized by the presence of Texas oaks. These sites occur on sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Because of the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site.

Reference Community
This is the interpretive or representative plant community for the Adobe site. The data for this plant community is derived from field data collection, review of historical descriptions and professional interpretation of several representative locations. The reference plant community for the site is a plant community composed of tall and mid grasses plus scattered live oaks. The overstory canopy averages about 10 percent for the site and consists primarily of live oak, but may include Texas oak and sumac species (Rhus spp.). Other shrubs common to the site are algerita (Mahonia trifoliata), sotol (Dasylirion texanum), sacahuista (Nolina texana) and several associated species. Mid and tall grasses dominate much of the site, though portions of these sites often supported a shrub and tree communities in mosaic patterns along with some seeps or spring flow. The integrity of the reference plant community can be maintained with a few management practices. Hand cutting or mechanical alternatives are options to keep this site in a mosaic Grassland Savannah Community. Prescribed burning is also a natural, effective and economical practice for the flatter slopes of this site. Individual Plant Treatment (IPT) alternatives are other sources of brush management, which may be effective on the steeper slopes. When retrogression is livestock induced, the tall grasses are replaced by a dominance of mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), and perennial threeawn (Aristida spp.). With continued abuse, the site is dominated by perennial threeawn, muhly spp. (Muhlenbergia), poverty dropseed (Sporobolus vaginiflorus), hairy tridens, cedar sedge (Carex planostachys), and rabbit tobacco (Evax prolifera). Ashe juniper will readily invade the site and become dominate when no management efforts are applied and regardless of grazing pressure except for goats.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on drainages with deep alluvial soils. Reference vegetation includes a mixture of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. Overtime, without fire or brush management, woody species may dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Loamy Bottomland ecological site, the soils are very deep, loamy, and calcareous. They are well drained, and permeability is moderate to rapid. The site receives extra water from stream flooding and as runoff from adjacent higher sites. Surface runoff is slow and some areas are flooded for short periods. The soils have a high water holding capacity for plant use and are naturally fertile. The soil maybe underlain with material comprised of 65 to 90 percent rounded alluvial gravels, cobbles, and stones at depths of 12 to greater than 80 inches. The site produces high yields of palatable and nutritious forage. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site.

Reference Community
This plant community is a Tallgrass Savannah Bottomland with high plant diversity and structure. The information for this plant community is interpolated from historical writings, NRCS range site descriptions, limited clipping studies, and professional consensus. This is the diagnostic or reference plant community for the Loamy Bottomland site. Pecan, live oak, walnut, sycamore, cypress, hackberry (Celtis spp.), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia.), western soapberry (Sapindus saponaria), cottonwood, and willow (Salix spp.) shade 10 to 30 percent of the ground. This is the preferred site for pecan. The understory is composed principally of little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, southwestern bristlegrass, Virginia wildrye, and perennial forbs, with smaller amounts of shrubs and woody vines. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass, along with numerous forbs and browse species occur immediately adjacent to watercourses. These species have a positive effect on streambank stabilization during flooding events. Removal of these species by over-harvesting and other effects leads to increased streambank erosion and drainage of the water table in some instances. Plants growing at the edge of the stream such as spikerush (Eliocharis spp.) and knotgrass (Paspalum distichum) can exhibit above ground production levels of 6,198 pounds per acre with root biomass of 27, 667 and 24,527 pounds per acre respectively. Root lengths of these plants have been recorded as high as 22 and 18.8 miles per square foot respectively (Cornwall, 1998). Any impact that excessively removes leaf material of the grasses over long periods of time will force a vegetational shift from tallgrass to midgrass then eventually to a cool season grass community. Birds import seeds from numerous tree and shrub species, the major one being Ashe juniper. Left unmanaged, the site will transition to a woodland of hardwood species with a dense understory of juniper and other shrubby species. Canopy cover can then be as high as 100 percent.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on moderately deep to deep clay loam soils over limestone. The reference vegetation on these upland sites consists of tallgrasses, numerous forbs, few shrubs and scattered live oak mottes. Without fire or brush management, woody species are likely to increase across the site. Grazing management is key to maintain the reference vegetation.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Clay Loam ecological site, the soils of this site are dark grayish brown, moderately deep to very deep clays or clay loams. Limestone fragments and rocks sometimes occur in the profile or outcrop on the soil surface, but not to the extent that they impair the production of native vegetation. Plant-soil moisture relationships are good. In healthy condition, rills, gullies, wind-scoured areas, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. It should be noted that there may be inclusions of other soils that because of mapping scale are not divided out. These may include some shallow soils with sporadic surface limestone fragments typical of the Eckrant series.

Reference Community
This is the reference or interpretive community for the site. The description is based on early range site descriptions, clipping data, the professional consensus of experienced range specialists, and analysis of field work. In reference condition, this site is a fire/herbivory managed, tallgrass savannah with about 10 percent woody canopy cover. Elm and hackberry trees occur along small streams, and Texas live oak trees or motts are widely scattered. Texas live oak can exist as both a tree and as a mott depending upon fire frequency or other disturbance as it is a vigorous root sprouter. Some juniper may occur depending upon the last fire or removal. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous plant community. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants and may be locally dominant. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass occurred in small quantities. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), silver (Bothriochloa saccharoides), and pinhole bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis var. perforata), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and tall/meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are also prevalent but in lesser amounts. The site grows an abundance of palatable forbs and legumes such as Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), velvet bundleflower (Desmanthus velutinus), and trailing wildbean (Strophostyles helvola). This plant community is very stable and can withstand short term droughts although production will fluctuate accordingly. If the site is abused by overgrazing of the site with cattle, a reduction of the more palatable tall and mid grasses, forbs, and legumes will occur. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver and pinhole bluestem, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) will increase. Texas wintergrass, along with a small amount of wildryes (Elymus spp.), often dominates the site and furnishes considerable cool-season forage. The cool season plants will also be more prominent when abundant fall rains occur. Fire on a 5- to 10-year frequency will help suppress shrubs and add to the cycling of minerals and nutrients. Fires prevent excessive buildup of litter. Research on the effects of fire on soil organisms reveal complex results and are ecosystem dependent. Soil fauna may decrease following a burn if the burn leaves the soil bare and not insulated (Wright, 1982). It is anticipated that a burn on this site, leaving some litter on the soil, may initially depress soil fauna but then experience an increase following a burn mainly because the sun warms the ground quicker. This leads to more rapid nutrient cycling and increased production and quality. In general, if burning follows historic fire return intervals, the litter and soil fauna will be sustainable (Scifres, 1980). Grazing has a dual effect in maintaining this grassland. Grazing assists in nutrient cycling by digesting coarse grasses and depositing the digested plants through manure back to the soil surface. However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

The Clay Loam ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie, dominated by little bluestem. The soils are shallow to deep and characterized by their clay loam texture.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep, well drained soils that have moderate to slow permeability. The the parent material is calcareous alluvium weathered from limestone hills. In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark grayish-brown, calcareous clay loam about 10 to 18 inches thick over a brown calcareous clay loam subsoil. Depth to bedrock ranges from 22 to more than 60 inches below the surface. The available water capacity is low to moderate. The following dominant soil series are: Altoga, Austin, Blum, Bonham, Culp, Cuthand, Howe, Krum, Lamar, Lewisville, Lott, McLennan, Seawillow, Sunev, Venus, and Whiteright. 

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is a true prairie with a few large live oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional mottes. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, 5 percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Little bluestem, Indiangrass, and big bluestem dominate the site. Other important grasses include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), switchgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Florida paspalum. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, hackberry, pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and elm, along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference prairie community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (i.e. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and sideoats grama. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and Texas wintergrass will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Prairie State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Soils are fertile with good permeability and produce abundant high quality palatable forage.

Ecological Site Concept
The Blackland ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie. Reference sites show an intact grass community with small clumped dispersal of woody species. The soils are moderately deep to very deep, richly black in color, and characterized by their shrink-swell nature. The sites are widely distributed across the uplands and terraces throughout the region.

Soil Features
The site consists of moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained soils that are slow to very slowly permeable. The upland soils formed in calcareous marl and marine sediments, high in smectitic clays. The terrace soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments. A few of the upland soils may have weathered and soft bedrock at a depth of more than 24 inches below the soil surface. The majority of this site is used for cropland due to the very deep, highly productive soils. There are some areas that are used for pasture or rangeland. In a representative profile, the surface layer is black clay about 24 inches thick. The clay extends below 24 inches and to depths of more than 80 inches. The subsoil is clay that grades from very dark gray to light olive brown as depth increases. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is moderate, and shrink swell potential is very high. The dominant associated soil series for the Blackland ecological site includes: Barbosa, Behring, Branyon, Burleson, Chatt, Dalco, Deport, Fairlie, Ferris, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Plant Community (1.1) is the reference community. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, five percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Indiangrass, big bluestem, eastern gamagrass, and switchgrass dominate the site. Little bluestem and Florida paspalum act as increasers when improper grazing management causes less grazing tolerant grasses to lose vigor. Other important grasses included Virginia wildrye, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), button snakeroot (Eryngium yuccifolium), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical but infrequent shrub and tree species include species of oak, hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.), along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference grassland community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (e.g. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and Florida paspalum. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and sideoats grama will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Grassland State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Species composition by weight remains an important descriptor of the herbaceous community and of the community as a whole. Woody species are included in species composition for the site. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Infiltration is rapid and runoff is very low when the soils are dry and open. Once soils have swelled to the point of sealing shut, infiltration is slow and runoff can occur. Soils with heavy plant cover contribute to increasing organic matter and soil building. The nearly level areas have gilgai. Sloping soils also have gilgai which create microridges and valleys extending up and down the slopes. Soil erosion is very low if tallgrasses and the water trapping gilgai are present. As much as six inches of water could be temporarily trapped in these gilgai microreliefs before runoff begins. Plowing removes the gilgai; it may take 20 years or more after plowing stops for the gilgai to reform.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clay Loam ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie, dominated by little bluestem. The soils are shallow to deep and characterized by their clay loam texture.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep, well drained soils that have moderate to slow permeability. The the parent material is calcareous alluvium weathered from limestone hills. In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark grayish-brown, calcareous clay loam about 10 to 18 inches thick over a brown calcareous clay loam subsoil. Depth to bedrock ranges from 22 to more than 60 inches below the surface. The available water capacity is low to moderate. The following dominant soil series are: Altoga, Austin, Blum, Bonham, Culp, Cuthand, Howe, Krum, Lamar, Lewisville, Lott, McLennan, Seawillow, Sunev, Venus, and Whiteright. 

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is a true prairie with a few large live oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional mottes. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, 5 percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Little bluestem, Indiangrass, and big bluestem dominate the site. Other important grasses include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), switchgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Florida paspalum. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, hackberry, pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and elm, along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference prairie community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (i.e. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and sideoats grama. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and Texas wintergrass will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Prairie State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Soils are fertile with good permeability and produce abundant high quality palatable forage.

Ecological Site Concept
The Claypan Prairie is a grassland site that occurs on nearly level, lower lying areas. Drainage in this site varies. The soils are characterized by a thin layer of fine sandy loam topsoil underlain by deep clay and clay loam subsoils.

Soil Features
The soils are very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in saline loamy alluvium. Brundage is the only series correlated and is classified as a fine-loamy, mixed, active, hyperthermic Aridic Natrustalfs.

Reference Community
The reference community is an open grassland dominated by midgrasses such as Arizona cottontop (Digitaria californica), false Rhodes grass (Trichloris crinita), multi-flowered false Rhodes grass (Trichloris pluriflora), longspike beardgrass (Bothriochloa longipaniculata), lovegrass tridens, sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), vine-mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and cane bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis). Also occurring, but in lesser amounts, are Texas bristlegrass (Setaria texana), buffalograss, plains bristlegrass (Setaria vulpiseta), hooded windmillgrass (Chloris cucullata), shortspike windmillgrass (Chloris subdolichostachya), and fall witchgrass (Digitaria cognata). Historically, this site is perceived to have had regular turnover in the herbaceous plant community between midgrasses, shortgrasses, and forbs because of drought and/or grazing. Individual grass species abundance is expected to fluctuate widely. Fire frequency is perceived to be variable and to occur in above average years followed by drought and/or prolonged dormant periods. The site is productive and maintained a high percentage of ground cover most of the time. During extended droughts, this ground cover of perennial grasses and forbs was often greatly reduced but had the resiliency to recover when favorable climatic conditions returned. A significant role for prescribed grazing is to build and maintain fine fuel amounts for effective prescribed burning. While periodic grazing was a natural component of the ecosystem, continuous abusive grazing has a strong negative impact on this site. Because of abusive grazing, the midgrasses decrease and are replaced by less palatable, short-lived grasses. Droughts hasten the process. Major grass increasers are slim tridens, red grama, buffalograss, curly mesquite, and lovegrass tridens. Mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), twisted acacia (Acacia schaffneri), and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) are the common plants that increase as abusive grazing persists.

Soil Features
The site consists of very shallow to moderately deep, well drained soils that are very slowly to moderately slowly permeability. The upland soils were formed in calcareous chalk and the terrace soils were formed in gravelly, clayey, and sandy alluvial sediments. In a representative profile the surface layer is light brownish gray, gravelly clay loam about 10 inches thick. Below 10 inches and to depths of more than 60 inches, the parent material is calcareous chalk. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is very low. The associated soil series for the Chalky Ridge are: Castephen, Doss, Eddy, Howe, Patrick, Queeny, Quihi, Stephen, and Whitewright.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community and is characterized as a tallgrass prairie with scattered trees and low-growing shrubs as well as a diverse population of perennial forbs. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous component of the site. Other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), dropseeds, hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), slim tridens (Tridens muticus var. muticus), rough tridens (Tridens muticus var. elongatus), buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), and curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri). A wide variety of forbs is commonly found on the site, including Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), awnless bushsunflower (Simsia calva), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), dotted gayfeather (Liatris punctata), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus berlandieri), bundleflowers (Desmanthus spp.), and many others. Scattered shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include live oak, hackberry, elm (Ulmus spp.), bumelia (Sideroxylon lanuginosum) skunkbush sumac (Rhus aromatica), and agarito (Mahonia trifoliolata). The reference Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) will transition to the Midgrass Prairie Community (1.2) with lack of fire, lack of brush control, long-term drought, repeated, long-term growing-season defoliation, and/or other repeated critical growing-season stress. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the grasses and forbs with the least tolerance for disturbance and highest moisture requirements (i.e. Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem. As shrub canopy cover increases, little bluestem will decrease and shade and drought tolerant midgrasses and forbs will increase in composition.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clay Loam ecological site is a true tallgrass prairie, dominated by little bluestem. The soils are shallow to deep and characterized by their clay loam texture.

Soil Features
The soils are shallow to very deep, well drained soils that have moderate to slow permeability. The the parent material is calcareous alluvium weathered from limestone hills. In a representative profile, the surface layer is dark grayish-brown, calcareous clay loam about 10 to 18 inches thick over a brown calcareous clay loam subsoil. Depth to bedrock ranges from 22 to more than 60 inches below the surface. The available water capacity is low to moderate. The following dominant soil series are: Altoga, Austin, Blum, Bonham, Culp, Cuthand, Howe, Krum, Lamar, Lewisville, Lott, McLennan, Seawillow, Sunev, Venus, and Whiteright. 

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is a true prairie with a few large live oak, elm (Ulmus spp.), and hackberry trees along the draws and in occasional mottes. It is characterized by deeper soils dominated by warm-season, perennial tallgrasses, with warm-season, perennial midgrasses filling most of the remaining species composition. The warm-season, perennial forb component varies between 5 and 15 percent depending on climatic patterns and local precipitation. Woody species make up a minor component of the community, 5 percent by weight, even in the short-term absence of fire (two to five years). Little bluestem, Indiangrass, and big bluestem dominate the site. Other important grasses include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), switchgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Florida paspalum. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, hackberry, pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and elm, along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference prairie community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (i.e. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and sideoats grama. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and Texas wintergrass will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Prairie State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Soils are fertile with good permeability and produce abundant high quality palatable forage.

Little bluestem, Indiangrass, and big bluestem dominate the site. Other important grasses include Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), switchgrass, sideoats grama, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), Texas wintergrass, and Florida paspalum. Forbs commonly found on the site include Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), blacksamson (Echinacea angustifolia), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus serrulatus), sensitive-briar (Mimosa spp.), and yellow neptunia (Neptunia lutea). Typical, but infrequent, shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include species of oak, hackberry, pecan (Carya illinoinensis), and elm, along with bumelia (Sideroxylon spp.) and coralberry (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus). The reference prairie community will transition to a midgrass-dominated community under the stresses of improper grazing management. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (i.e. eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and sideoats grama. If improper grazing management continues, little bluestem and Florida paspalum will decrease and midgrasses such as silver bluestem and Texas wintergrass will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will increase at this stage. Because the woody species that dominate in the Shrubland State are native species that occur as part of the Prairie State, the transition to the Shrubland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 35 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 35 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Shrubland State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between community and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. This plant community has very little bare ground. Plant basal cover and litter make up almost 100 percent ground cover. Soils are fertile with good permeability and produce abundant high quality palatable forage.

Ecological Site Concept
The Chalky Ridge site is a true tallgrass prairie. The sites are characterized by very shallow to moderately deep soils that are high in calcium carbonate.

Soil Features
The site consists of very shallow to moderately deep, well drained soils that are very slowly to moderately slowly permeability. The upland soils were formed in calcareous chalk and the terrace soils were formed in gravelly, clayey, and sandy alluvial sediments. In a representative profile the surface layer is light brownish gray, gravelly clay loam about 10 inches thick. Below 10 inches and to depths of more than 60 inches, the parent material is calcareous chalk. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is very low. The associated soil series for the Chalky Ridge are: Castephen, Doss, Eddy, Howe, Patrick, Queeny, Quihi, Stephen, and Whitewright.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community and is characterized as a tallgrass prairie with scattered trees and low-growing shrubs as well as a diverse population of perennial forbs. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous component of the site. Other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), dropseeds, hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), slim tridens (Tridens muticus var. muticus), rough tridens (Tridens muticus var. elongatus), buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), and curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri). A wide variety of forbs is commonly found on the site, including Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), awnless bushsunflower (Simsia calva), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), dotted gayfeather (Liatris punctata), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus berlandieri), bundleflowers (Desmanthus spp.), and many others. Scattered shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include live oak, hackberry, elm (Ulmus spp.), bumelia (Sideroxylon lanuginosum) skunkbush sumac (Rhus aromatica), and agarito (Mahonia trifoliolata). The reference Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) will transition to the Midgrass Prairie Community (1.2) with lack of fire, lack of brush control, long-term drought, repeated, long-term growing-season defoliation, and/or other repeated critical growing-season stress. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the grasses and forbs with the least tolerance for disturbance and highest moisture requirements (i.e. Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem. As shrub canopy cover increases, little bluestem will decrease and shade and drought tolerant midgrasses and forbs will increase in composition.

Ecological Site Concept
The Redlands Ecological Site has non-calcareous soils over limestone. The reference vegetation is an oak savannah with mid and tallgrasses, forbs and few shrubs. Without periodic fire or brush management, woody species will likely increase and dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Redland ecological site, the soils are shallow, brown or reddish brown, fertile clays, and clay loams. They are underlain by slightly fractured indurated limestone bedrock at depths of 20 inches or less. Plant roots penetrate the crevices, which are usually filled with reddish brown clay. Limestone fragments, cherts, cobbles and stones sometimes occur on the surface and may make up as much as 25 percent of the soil by volume. When dry, the soils crack and take in water rapidly. When wet, the cracks close, and the soils become sticky and plastic and take in water slowly. Light showers are ineffective on the site, which favors the growth of deep-rooted perennial plants. When plant residues are inadequate, soil condition deteriorates and heavy surface crusts develop. In this condition water intake is very slow, runoff is rapid, erosion is a hazard, and grass recovery is slow. The stones on the surface reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The mineral content and reaction of these soils enable the site to produce highly nutritious forage. In association with other sites, Redland is usually the preferred grazing area. These sites occur on more stable hillslopes on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative map units associated with the Redland ecological site are: Hensley association, undulating Tarpley association, undulating

Reference Community
The Oak Savannah Community (1.1) is the interpretive plant community. This plant community is a fire/grazing managed savannah composed of tall grasses. The overstory shades around10 percent of the site and consists primarily of post oak, but may include Bigelow oak (Quercus buckleyi), Texas red oak (Quercus texana), Texas live oak, blackjack oak and several associated species. The post oak and blackjack oak are signature key indicators of the Redland site. Occasionally however there may only be Texas live oak. The role of historic fire and bison grazing was to keep sunlight energy flowing through the deep-rooted trees and grasses, accelerate the mineral and nutrient cycle and to capture the optimum amount of rainfall. The removal or alteration of these ecological disturbances will trigger the plant community to change. The total removal of grazing animals may, in fact, accelerate this change. Juniper is added to the site via droppings from perching birds and small mammals that eat the seeds. Ashe juniper, which is a nonsprouting woody plant easily controlled by fire, and other woody species will increase without fire or some form of brush management. Once Ashe juniper encroachments it can easily be controlled with prescribed fire. When the juniper exceeds about 6 feet in height, fire options become limited. Without intervention, the Ashe juniper will continue to increase and move towards the Oak/Juniper Grassland plant community (1.2). This may occur in as little as five years.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on moderately deep to deep clay loam soils over limestone. The reference vegetation on these upland sites consists of tallgrasses, numerous forbs, few shrubs and scattered live oak mottes. Without fire or brush management, woody species are likely to increase across the site. Grazing management is key to maintain the reference vegetation.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Clay Loam ecological site, the soils of this site are dark grayish brown, moderately deep to very deep clays or clay loams. Limestone fragments and rocks sometimes occur in the profile or outcrop on the soil surface, but not to the extent that they impair the production of native vegetation. Plant-soil moisture relationships are good. In healthy condition, rills, gullies, wind-scoured areas, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. It should be noted that there may be inclusions of other soils that because of mapping scale are not divided out. These may include some shallow soils with sporadic surface limestone fragments typical of the Eckrant series. The following representative soils associated with the Clay Loam ecological site are Bolar, Krum, and Pratley. These are the representative map units associated with the Clay Loam ecological site: Bolar clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes Krum clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes Krum clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes Krum-Pratley association, gently undulating Pratley clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes

Reference Community
This is the reference or interpretive community for the site. The description is based on early range site descriptions, clipping data, the professional consensus of experienced range specialists, and analysis of field work. In reference condition, this site is a fire/herbivory managed, tallgrass savannah with about 10 percent woody canopy cover. Elm and hackberry trees occur along small streams, and Texas live oak trees or motts are widely scattered. Texas live oak can exist as both a tree and as a mott depending upon fire frequency or other disturbance as it is a vigorous root sprouter. Some juniper may occur depending upon the last fire or removal. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous plant community. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants and may be locally dominant. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass occurred in small quantities. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), silver (Bothriochloa saccharoides), and pinhole bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis var. perforata), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and tall/meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are also prevalent but in lesser amounts. The site grows an abundance of palatable forbs and legumes such as Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), velvet bundleflower (Desmanthus velutinus), and trailing wildbean (Strophostyles helvola). This plant community is very stable and can withstand short term droughts although production will fluctuate accordingly. If the site is abused by overgrazing of the site with cattle, a reduction of the more palatable tall and mid grasses, forbs, and legumes will occur. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver and pinhole bluestem, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) will increase. Texas wintergrass, along with a small amount of wildryes (Elymus spp.), often dominates the site and furnishes considerable cool-season forage. The cool season plants will also be more prominent when abundant fall rains occur. Fire on a 5- to 10-year frequency will help suppress shrubs and add to the cycling of minerals and nutrients. Fires prevent excessive buildup of litter. Research on the effects of fire on soil organisms reveal complex results and are ecosystem dependent. Soil fauna may decrease following a burn if the burn leaves the soil bare and not insulated (Wright, 1982). It is anticipated that a burn on this site, leaving some litter on the soil, may initially depress soil fauna but then experience an increase following a burn mainly because the sun warms the ground quicker. This leads to more rapid nutrient cycling and increased production and quality. In general, if burning follows historic fire return intervals, the litter and soil fauna will be sustainable (Scifres, 1980). Grazing has a dual effect in maintaining this grassland. Grazing assists in nutrient cycling by digesting coarse grasses and depositing the digested plants through manure back to the soil surface. However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on very shallow and shallow clay loam soils over indurated limestone bedrock. The reference vegetation includes tall and midgrasses along with numerous forbs and scattered mottes of live oak. Without fire or brush management, juniper and other woody species are likely to increase across the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Low Stony Hill ecological site, these soils are very shallow or shallow to indurated limestone. Depth of bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches. The soil is a black clayey soil and is neutral to alkaline. Subrounded to angular pebbles, cobbles, and stones of limestone comprise 35 to 70 percent by volume of the soil. Surface fragments reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The soils are fertile, usually have good structure, and take in water readily. Their fertility and moisture-holding capacity, however, is limited by soil depth and fragment volume. Fractures in the limestone bedrock, on the other hand, generally contain fine soil particles and store moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. Forage produced on the site is of good quality. These sites occur on interfluves and sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative soil associated with the Low Stony Hill ecological site is Eckrant.

Reference Community
The data for this community is derived from field data collections and professional consensus. This site is a fire managed, open grassland with scattered oak mottes with about 10 to 20 percent tree canopy. The live oak is most abundant along watercourses, where elm (Ulmus spp.) and hackberry (Celtis spp.) trees also grow. Under a fire regime, the live oak can exist both as a tree and as a mott or thicket as it is a vigorous root sprouter. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants, and may even dominate locally. Also native to the site, but occurring less frequency or in lesser amounts are the wildryes (Elymus spp.), Sideoats grama, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), feathery bluestems (Bothriochloa spp.), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). The site also grows an abundance of forbs, shrubs and woody vines. Overstocking and thus overgrazing by domesticated animals can cause a decline and even the elimination of numerous plants from this community. As the plant community degenerates, big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, and the wildryes decrease. Sideoats grama, tall dropseed, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) are initial increasers on the site. Prolonged overuse of these plants usually results in a community of Texas wintergrass, curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri), buffalograss, and woody species. The following grasses and forbs are commonly found on this site in a deteriorated condition: Western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), Broomweed (Amphiachyris spp.), prairie coneflower (Ratibida columnifera), Snow-on-the-Mountain (Euphorbia marginata), silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), Leavenworth eryngo (Eryngium leavenworthii), twin-leaf senna (Cassia roemariana), gray goldaster (Heterotheca canescens), horehound (Marrabium vulgare), evax (Evax spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), red grama (Bouteloua trifida), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus panniculatus), windmillgrasses (Chloris spp.), and annual brome grasses (Bromus spp.).

Without periodic fire or brush management, woody species may increase and dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Adobe ecological site, the soils are shallow to moderately deep, usually gravelly, light-colored loam or clay loam over weakly or moderately cemented limestone with thin beds of indurated limestone. Rock fragments in the surface horizons are about 20 percent and up to 85 percent in the subsoil. There are gravelly to extremely gravelly or paragravelly to extremely paragravelly texture modifiers throughout the soil profile. The permeability of the soil is moderate and the permeability of the paralithic material is very slow to slow. On erosional sideslope positions, the organic matter development in the topsoil is low. Because of high runoff and high calcium carbonate content, the soils are droughty. They do not support a dense cover of plants, which require high amounts of water and plant nutrients. Runoff is rapid, even under good plant cover. Forage grown on the site is usually low in nutritive value and must be supplemented, especially with phosphorus as the high calcium levels tie up the phosphorus.

Reference Community
This is the interpretive or representative plant community for the Adobe site. The data for this plant community is derived from field data collection, review of historical descriptions and professional interpretation of several representative locations. The reference plant community for the site is a plant community composed of tall and mid grasses plus scattered live oaks. The overstory canopy averages about 10 percent for the site and consists primarily of live oak, but may include Texas oak and sumac species (Rhus spp.). Other shrubs common to the site are algerita (Mahonia trifoliata), sotol (Dasylirion texanum), sacahuista (Nolina texana) and several associated species. Mid and tall grasses dominate much of the site, though portions of these sites often supported a shrub and tree communities in mosaic patterns along with some seeps or spring flow. The integrity of the reference plant community can be maintained with a few management practices. Hand cutting or mechanical alternatives are options to keep this site in a mosaic Grassland Savannah Community. Prescribed burning is also a natural, effective and economical practice for the flatter slopes of this site. Individual Plant Treatment (IPT) alternatives are other sources of brush management, which may be effective on the steeper slopes. When retrogression is livestock induced, the tall grasses are replaced by a dominance of mid and short grasses such as sideoats grama, hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), and perennial threeawn (Aristida spp.). With continued abuse, the site is dominated by perennial threeawn, muhly spp. (Muhlenbergia), poverty dropseed (Sporobolus vaginiflorus), hairy tridens, cedar sedge (Carex planostachys), and rabbit tobacco (Evax prolifera). Ashe juniper will readily invade the site and become dominate when no management efforts are applied and regardless of grazing pressure except for goats.

When plant residues are inadequate, soil condition deteriorates and heavy surface crusts develop. In this condition water intake is very slow, runoff is rapid, erosion is a hazard, and grass recovery is slow. The stones on the surface reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The mineral content and reaction of these soils enable the site to produce highly nutritious forage. In association with other sites, Redland is usually the preferred grazing area. These sites occur on more stable hillslopes on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units.

Reference Community
The Oak Savannah Community (1.1) is the interpretive plant community. This plant community is a fire/grazing managed savannah composed of tall grasses. The overstory shades around10 percent of the site and consists primarily of post oak, but may include Bigelow oak (Quercus buckleyi), Texas red oak (Quercus texana), Texas live oak, blackjack oak and several associated species. The post oak and blackjack oak are signature key indicators of the Redland site. Occasionally however there may only be Texas live oak. The role of historic fire and bison grazing was to keep sunlight energy flowing through the deep-rooted trees and grasses, accelerate the mineral and nutrient cycle and to capture the optimum amount of rainfall. The removal or alteration of these ecological disturbances will trigger the plant community to change. The total removal of grazing animals may, in fact, accelerate this change. Juniper is added to the site via droppings from perching birds and small mammals that eat the seeds. Ashe juniper, which is a nonsprouting woody plant easily controlled by fire, and other woody species will increase without fire or some form of brush management. Once Ashe juniper encroachments it can easily be controlled with prescribed fire. When the juniper exceeds about 6 feet in height, fire options become limited. Without intervention, the Ashe juniper will continue to increase and move towards the Oak/Juniper Grassland plant community (1.2). This may occur in as little as five years.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on moderately deep to deep clay loam soils over limestone. The reference vegetation on these upland sites consists of tallgrasses, numerous forbs, few shrubs and scattered live oak mottes. Without fire or brush management, woody species are likely to increase across the site. Grazing management is key to maintain the reference vegetation.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Clay Loam ecological site, the soils of this site are dark grayish brown, moderately deep to very deep clays or clay loams. Limestone fragments and rocks sometimes occur in the profile or outcrop on the soil surface, but not to the extent that they impair the production of native vegetation. Plant-soil moisture relationships are good. In healthy condition, rills, gullies, wind-scoured areas, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. It should be noted that there may be inclusions of other soils that because of mapping scale are not divided out. These may include some shallow soils with sporadic surface limestone fragments typical of the Eckrant series. The following representative soils associated with the Clay Loam ecological site are Bolar, Krum, and Pratley.

Reference Community
This is the reference or interpretive community for the site. The description is based on early range site descriptions, clipping data, the professional consensus of experienced range specialists, and analysis of field work. In reference condition, this site is a fire/herbivory managed, tallgrass savannah with about 10 percent woody canopy cover. Elm and hackberry trees occur along small streams, and Texas live oak trees or motts are widely scattered. Texas live oak can exist as both a tree and as a mott depending upon fire frequency or other disturbance as it is a vigorous root sprouter. Some juniper may occur depending upon the last fire or removal. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous plant community. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants and may be locally dominant. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass occurred in small quantities. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), silver (Bothriochloa saccharoides), and pinhole bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis var. perforata), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and tall/meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are also prevalent but in lesser amounts. The site grows an abundance of palatable forbs and legumes such as Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), velvet bundleflower (Desmanthus velutinus), and trailing wildbean (Strophostyles helvola). This plant community is very stable and can withstand short term droughts although production will fluctuate accordingly. If the site is abused by overgrazing of the site with cattle, a reduction of the more palatable tall and mid grasses, forbs, and legumes will occur. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver and pinhole bluestem, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) will increase. Texas wintergrass, along with a small amount of wildryes (Elymus spp.), often dominates the site and furnishes considerable cool-season forage. The cool season plants will also be more prominent when abundant fall rains occur. Fire on a 5- to 10-year frequency will help suppress shrubs and add to the cycling of minerals and nutrients. Fires prevent excessive buildup of litter. Research on the effects of fire on soil organisms reveal complex results and are ecosystem dependent. Soil fauna may decrease following a burn if the burn leaves the soil bare and not insulated (Wright, 1982). It is anticipated that a burn on this site, leaving some litter on the soil, may initially depress soil fauna but then experience an increase following a burn mainly because the sun warms the ground quicker. This leads to more rapid nutrient cycling and increased production and quality. In general, if burning follows historic fire return intervals, the litter and soil fauna will be sustainable (Scifres, 1980). Grazing has a dual effect in maintaining this grassland. Grazing assists in nutrient cycling by digesting coarse grasses and depositing the digested plants through manure back to the soil surface. However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on very shallow and shallow clay loam soils over indurated limestone bedrock. The reference vegetation includes tall and midgrasses along with numerous forbs and scattered mottes of live oak. Without fire or brush management, juniper and other woody species are likely to increase across the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Low Stony Hill ecological site, these soils are very shallow or shallow to indurated limestone. Depth of bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches. The soil is a black clayey soil and is neutral to alkaline. Subrounded to angular pebbles, cobbles, and stones of limestone comprise 35 to 70 percent by volume of the soil. Surface fragments reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The soils are fertile, usually have good structure, and take in water readily. Their fertility and moisture-holding capacity, however, is limited by soil depth and fragment volume. Fractures in the limestone bedrock, on the other hand, generally contain fine soil particles and store moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. Forage produced on the site is of good quality. These sites occur on interfluves and sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative soil associated with the Low Stony Hill ecological site is Eckrant.

Reference Community
The data for this community is derived from field data collections and professional consensus. This site is a fire managed, open grassland with scattered oak mottes with about 10 to 20 percent tree canopy. The live oak is most abundant along watercourses, where elm (Ulmus spp.) and hackberry (Celtis spp.) trees also grow. Under a fire regime, the live oak can exist both as a tree and as a mott or thicket as it is a vigorous root sprouter. The herbaceous plant community is dominated by little bluestem. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants, and may even dominate locally. Also native to the site, but occurring less frequency or in lesser amounts are the wildryes (Elymus spp.), Sideoats grama, tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), feathery bluestems (Bothriochloa spp.), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), and Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea). The site also grows an abundance of forbs, shrubs and woody vines. Overstocking and thus overgrazing by domesticated animals can cause a decline and even the elimination of numerous plants from this community. As the plant community degenerates, big bluestem, little bluestem, Indiangrass, and the wildryes decrease. Sideoats grama, tall dropseed, silver bluestem, Texas wintergrass, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) are initial increasers on the site. Prolonged overuse of these plants usually results in a community of Texas wintergrass, curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri), buffalograss, and woody species. The following grasses and forbs are commonly found on this site in a deteriorated condition: Western ragweed (Ambrosia psilostachya), Broomweed (Amphiachyris spp.), prairie coneflower (Ratibida columnifera), Snow-on-the-Mountain (Euphorbia marginata), silverleaf nightshade (Solanum elaeagnifolium), milkweeds (Asclepias spp.), Leavenworth eryngo (Eryngium leavenworthii), twin-leaf senna (Cassia roemariana), gray goldaster (Heterotheca canescens), horehound (Marrabium vulgare), evax (Evax spp.), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), hairy tridens (Erioneuron pilosum), red grama (Bouteloua trifida), tumblegrass (Schedonnardus panniculatus), windmillgrasses (Chloris spp.), and annual brome grasses (Bromus spp.).

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on gravelly clay loam soils on steep slopes. The reference vegetation includes a savannah of live oak and Texas red oak with midgrasses, tallgrasses, forbs and few shrubs. Without periodic fire or other brush management, juniper and other woody species will likely increase across the site.

Soil Features
The representative soils of this site are very shallow, shallow, and moderately deep, usually gravelly, light-colored loam and clay loam over soft limestone. Because of slope, runoff is rapid even under good plant cover. In the absence of plant cover and residues, the soils crust readily. The soil formed in residuum over interbedded limestone and marl. These soils are strongly calcareous and have low water holding capacity. For these reasons, the site is droughty. Forage grown on this site is usually low in plant nutrients, especially phosphorus. In a representative profile, the surface layer is a pale brown gravelly clay loam ranging from 0 to 15 inches in depth. The substratum in the Kerrville Series is 15 to 24 inches of marl with indurated limestone bedrock at 24 to 30 inches. In the Real and Brackett Series, the substratum ranges from 13 to 60 inches of interbedded marl. In these two series, after 20 inches, the potential for hitting indurated limestone bedrock increases with depth. Most map units contain slopes that are convex and range from 8 percent to 30 percent slopes on Steep Adobe sites. Kerrville and Brackett soils may range from 20 percent to 60 percent. Horizontal outcrops of limestone give the slopes a stair-stepped or benched appearance. Angular limestone pebbles and cobbles are on the surface of some areas. Sites with less than 20 percent slopes are more accessible to vehicle and livestock traffic. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative soils associated with the Steep Adobe ecological site are Brackett, Kerrville, and Real.

Reference Community
The Mid-Tallgrass Savannah (1.1) will be the reference community as it is perceived to have been the most extensive community. The data for this community is derived from old range site descriptions, professional consensus, and professional interpretation of collected data. This community is composed of mid and tall grasses plus scattered live oaks, Texas oaks, shrubs, forbs, and juniper. Percent canopy for this site is variable depending on the geologic formations which influence vegetation types. The overstory canopy may average about 20 percent for the site, with isolated areas being very dense and others being very open. Common woody species will be live oak, Texas oak, Ashe juniper, Bigelow oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba), sumac walnut (Juglans spp.), madrone, and several associated species. Tall and mid grasses dominate the open areas throughout the site while far less herbaceous cover may exist in the shrub and tree community. Because of slope direction and exposure, woody species will vary. For example, Lacey (Quercus laceyi), Bigelow oak, and Ashe juniper are found more on the north facing slopes while the drier shrubland or thinner woody species occurs on the south facing slopes. Some seeps or spring flow would be present to add to the mosaic pattern of the site. Periodic fires and limited grazing by bison and other herbivores were natural processes that maintained this mosaic plant community. When species such as little bluestem, Indiangrass, sideoats grama, and Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia) are grazed out of the plant community, herbaceous species are replaced by Wright's threeawn (Aristida wrightii), canyon and seep muhly, and Ashe juniper. If heavy grazing continues for many years, retrogression of the plant community will occur and species such as Ashe juniper and other low succession species will increase. With no brush control and continued overgrazing, all palatable plants will disappear and juniper and oaks will dominate the site. It should be noted that Ashe juniper will also increase independently of grazing as its seeds are spread by birds and other animals. Ashe juniper (which originally occurred as a mosaic along more protected rocky, craggy outcrops on the steeper portions of the side where it was protected from historic fires) may increase to form a dense canopy and will suppress other vegetation. Soil, plant, and watershed health indicators are negatively impacted when the site is allowed to deteriorate. The integrity of the Reference Plant Community can be maintained with a few management practices. Brush control, proper stocking rates, and deferments can allow the site to respond positively relative to plant and soil health. Hand cutting of juniper and/or prescribed burning are examples of viable practices for the flatter slopes of this site. Individual Plant Treatment (IPT) alternatives are other options which may be effective. The Reference Plant community is a stable community with sunlight energy cycling through several functional groups such as warm season grasses, cool season grasses, trees, and shrubs. Erosion does occur naturally along steeper drains but for the most part, the site is stable.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on steep, shallow soils with numerous stones and/or boulders present. Reference vegetation includes an oak savannah with mid and tallgrasses, forbs and numerous shrubs. These sites have historically carried more woody species due to some areas being protected from recurring fires. However, if fire is removed completely, woody species are likely to increase across the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Steep Rocky ecological site, these soils are very shallow or shallow to indurated limestone. Depth of bedrock ranges from 4 to 20 inches. The soil is a black clayey soil and is neutral to alkaline. Stones and boulders cover 35 to 65 percent of the soil surface. Ledges of hard limestone outcrop on the contour, giving a banded appearance. The soils are fertile, usually have good structure, and take in water readily. Their fertility and moisture-holding capacity, however, is limited by soil depth and fragment volume. Fractures in the limestone bedrock, on the other hand, generally contain fine soil particles and store some moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. Forage produced on the site is of good quality. These sites occur on sideslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units.

Reference Community
The Mid- and Tallgrass Savannah Community is the interpretive plant community for this and is a diverse mosaic. The information for this site is derived from vegetation inventories and professional opinion of range trained individuals. It is recognized the north slopes will have denser stands of juniper, however, the south slope is selected as the interpretive or diagnostic plant community as it is more dynamic. The density and frequency of woody vegetation is strongly dependent on the presence or absence of fractured limestone and exposure. Where non-fractured geology exists, canopies will be less dense. Large deep-rooted trees are rare. Northern facing exposures have higher canopy covers and larger trees than southern exposures. This site was referred to as a ""cedar brake"" by early explorers (Roemer, 1846) because of the juniper dominance in several locations. The absence or presence of juniper was directly related to the fire frequency and intensity but many times was limited by rock outcrops, lack of fuel or escarpments. The overstory canopy may be as much as 35 percent. Moreover, the canopy varied considerably over the full range of the site. The woody canopy consists primarily of Texas live oak, Texas red oak, Ashe juniper, white shin oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba), Lacey oak (Quercus laceyi), and several associated species. Unique indicator plants such as Lindheimer's silk tassel (Garrya ovata var. lindheimeri), Texas madrone (Arbutus xalapensis), bigtooth maple, escarpment black cherry (Prunus serotina), and walnut species (Juglans spp.) occurred in fractured limestone. Numerous forbs such as zexmenia (Wedelia spp.), Dalea (Dalea spp.), sundrop (Calyophus spp.), bundleflower (Desmanthus spp.), and gayfeather (Liatris spp.) frequent the site. Mid and tallgrasses are dominants of the site although a large portion of these sites often supported a shrub and tree community. The structure of many of the woody plants on this site, such as live oak, can exist either as a tree or as a shrub or thicket because of their resprouting ability following fire or top damage. Juniper is the exception, being a non-sprouter. Not only did periodic fires maintain the reference plant community in a mosaic nature but droughts are known to kill woody plants such as live oak and juniper (Wills, 2006). Retrogression of the site comes mainly from juniper. Juniper functions as an increaser on this site as it is native. Heavy browsing by livestock and wildlife weakens palatable browse and offers juniper an opportunity to increase. When retrogression is cattle induced (on the lower ranges of the slope), little bluestem, green sprangletop, sideoats grama, and the minor species Indiangrass, big bluestem, and palatable forbs are the primary decreasers. Feathery bluestems (Bothriochloa spp.), tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus var. compositus), Texas wintergrass, tridens (Tridens spp.), threeawn (Aristida spp.), and woody species are increasers. Slim tridens (Tridens muticus), rough tridens (Tridens muticus var. elongatus), and threeawn (Aristida spp.) are the most persistent of the grasses under abusive use. Juniper can increase regardless of browsing. Seeds eaten by birds and deposited in the understory of other woody species will germinate and establish in the absence of fire. Over a period of time, the juniper will eventually dominate its surrogate woody plant. Other wildlife species will also eat the juniper berries then fecally deposit them over the site (Smeins, 1997). This process may take 20 or so years depending upon the rate of introduction and the fire frequency. Once juniper reaches approximately a 30 percent canopy, a threshold is being approached. At this point, the fine fuel necessary for an effective fire is diminished except for severe, catastrophic type fires. Because of the steep nature of this site, only a very few management practices can be used for maintenance. Hand cutting of juniper is an example to keep the canopy open enough to maintain some vegetative cover even though it is labor intensive. Mechanical clipping can be done on the lower slope classes. If selective removal is done, there is usually enough seed source for the site to recover once historic disturbances are returned. It is recognized that fire did not completely burn this site nor is it always feasible to burn because of difficult terrain.

Ecological Site Concept
The Chalky Ridge site is a true tallgrass prairie. The sites are characterized by very shallow to moderately deep soils that are high in calcium carbonate.

Soil Features
The site consists of very shallow to moderately deep, well drained soils that are very slowly to moderately slowly permeability. The upland soils were formed in calcareous chalk and the terrace soils were formed in gravelly, clayey, and sandy alluvial sediments. In a representative profile the surface layer is light brownish gray, gravelly clay loam about 10 inches thick. Below 10 inches and to depths of more than 60 inches, the parent material is calcareous chalk. Available water capacity to a depth of 60 inches is very low. The associated soil series for the Chalky Ridge are: Castephen, Doss, Eddy, Howe, Patrick, Queeny, Quihi, Stephen, and Whitewright.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) is the reference community and is characterized as a tallgrass prairie with scattered trees and low-growing shrubs as well as a diverse population of perennial forbs. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous component of the site. Other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides), dropseeds, hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), slim tridens (Tridens muticus var. muticus), rough tridens (Tridens muticus var. elongatus), buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), and curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri). A wide variety of forbs is commonly found on the site, including Maximilian sunflower (Helianthus maximiliani), awnless bushsunflower (Simsia calva), Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), dotted gayfeather (Liatris punctata), halfshrub sundrop (Calylophus berlandieri), bundleflowers (Desmanthus spp.), and many others. Scattered shrub and tree species found in the reference community (1.1) include live oak, hackberry, elm (Ulmus spp.), bumelia (Sideroxylon lanuginosum) skunkbush sumac (Rhus aromatica), and agarito (Mahonia trifoliolata). The reference Tallgrass Prairie Community (1.1) will transition to the Midgrass Prairie Community (1.2) with lack of fire, lack of brush control, long-term drought, repeated, long-term growing-season defoliation, and/or other repeated critical growing-season stress. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the grasses and forbs with the least tolerance for disturbance and highest moisture requirements (i.e. Indiangrass, big bluestem, and Engelmann's daisy). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem. As shrub canopy cover increases, little bluestem will decrease and shade and drought tolerant midgrasses and forbs will increase in composition.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland is a tallgrass savannah. The site is unique because it has a hardwood overstory component with the tallgrasses. The soils are very deep clays and are associated with flooding regimes. Their heavy textured soils cause water to drain slowly and may stay for over a month.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, moderately well to very poorly drained, slow to impermeable soils. The floodplain soils were formed in alkaline residuum derived from shales and clays. In a representative profile, the surface layer is very dark gray clay. The subsoils are very dark gray to olive clay. Having high shrink-swell characteristics, the soils crack when dry. In this condition, they take in water rapidly. When the soils become wet and the cracks close. The soils are very fertile and hold large amounts of water for plant use. They also have a high wilting point which reduces forage yields in extremely dry years. The associated soil series are: Aufco, Elbon, Gladewater, Kaufman, Ovan, Redlake, Roetex, Seagoville, Ships, Tinn, Trinity, and Zilaboy.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Savannah Community (1.1) is the reference community and is characterized as a hardwood savannah with up to 20 percent tree and shrub canopy cover. Historic records in the 1700's do, however, indicate that early settlers and explorers found portions of this site to be heavily wooded. The Woodland Community (2.1) occurred as a stable community on portions of this ecological site. Other reports (Mann 2004) discuss the importance of human caused fire as an important factor in keeping open grasslands prior to European settlement. It is assumed the Tallgrass Savannah Community (1.1) occurred over the majority of this ecological site in a dynamically shifting mosaic over time with the other community in the Savannah State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between plant communities and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Sedges, Virginia wildrye, and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) dominate the herbaceous plant community in shaded and wet areas. The herbaceous community in the drier, open areas is dominated by beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, eastern gamagrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and Florida paspalum. The balance of warm and cool season tallgrasses will be driven by the amount of canopy cover from large trees, particularly the amount and size of stands with closed canopy. When the site is open and tree cover is less than 10 percent, warm season tallgrasses will approach 30 percent species composition by weight, while the cool season grasses will approach 10 percent. As tree cover approaches the upper limit of the reference community (20 percent), cool season grasses and grasslikes will approach 30 percent and warm season tallgrasses will approach 10 percent species composition by weight. Oak, elm, hackberry, cottonwood (Populus deltoids), ash (Fraxinus spp.), black willow (Salix nigra), pecan (Carya illinoensis), and other large trees create 20 percent canopy cover. The overstory canopy is densest adjacent to watercourses. Woody understory species include hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), grape (Vitis spp.), trumpet creeper (Parthenocissus spp.) and honeysuckle (Symphoricarpos spp.). Continuous, year-long grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the reference herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of common Bermudagrass, dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum), carpetgrass (Axonopus affinis), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and annual sumpweed (Iva annua). The reference Savannah community will shift to the Midgrass Savannah Community (1.2) under the stresses of improper grazing. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable and/or least grazing tolerant grasses and forbs (namely, eastern gamagrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem). This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and paspalums. If improper grazing continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as bushy bluestem (Andropogon glomeratus) and Vaseygrass (Paspalum urvillei) will increase in composition. Less palatable forbs will also increase at this stage. Without fire and/or brush control, woody species on the site will increase and the site will transition to the Woodland State. This can occur with or without the understory transitioning to the midgrass community. This transition can occur without degradation of the herbaceous community from dominance by tallgrasses to dominance by midgrasses. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 50 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process that is always in effect. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 50 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. Continuous, year-long grazing with no weed or brush management, or abandoning the site for several years, will allow shrub saplings to establish. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Woodland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Woodland State. The soils of this site are deep clays. The site receives additional water from outside the site as overflow or as runoff from adjacent sites. The soils have high shrink-swell characteristics. They crack when dry and the cracks take in water rapidly. Once wet, the cracks close and permeability becomes very slow. Soils are highly fertile and hold large amounts of soil moisture. However, the soils have a high wilting point, which reduces plant production in very dry years. In very wet years the site is subject to flooding, which reduces plant production and desirability of the site for grazing. This is a very productive site with high yields of palatable, high-quality forage. There is essentially no bare ground in this community. Plant basal cover and litter comprise all of the ground cover. Multiple layer canopy cover approaches 100 percent.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clayey Bottomland is a tallgrass savannah. The site is unique because it has a hardwood overstory component with the tallgrasses. The soils are very deep clays and are associated with flooding regimes. Their heavy textured soils cause water to drain slowly and may stay for over a month.

Soil Features
The site consists of very deep, moderately well to very poorly drained, slow to impermeable soils. The floodplain soils were formed in alkaline residuum derived from shales and clays. In a representative profile, the surface layer is very dark gray clay. The subsoils are very dark gray to olive clay. Having high shrink-swell characteristics, the soils crack when dry. In this condition, they take in water rapidly. When the soils become wet and the cracks close. The soils are very fertile and hold large amounts of water for plant use.

Reference Community
The Tallgrass Savannah Community (1.1) is the reference community and is characterized as a hardwood savannah with up to 20 percent tree and shrub canopy cover. Historic records in the 1700's do, however, indicate that early settlers and explorers found portions of this site to be heavily wooded. The Woodland Community (2.1) occurred as a stable community on portions of this ecological site. Other reports (Mann 2004) discuss the importance of human caused fire as an important factor in keeping open grasslands prior to European settlement. It is assumed the Tallgrass Savannah Community (1.1) occurred over the majority of this ecological site in a dynamically shifting mosaic over time with the other community in the Savannah State. Canopy cover drives the transitions between plant communities and states because of the influence of shade and interception of rainfall. Sedges, Virginia wildrye, and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) dominate the herbaceous plant community in shaded and wet areas. The herbaceous community in the drier, open areas is dominated by beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, eastern gamagrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and Florida paspalum. The balance of warm and cool season tallgrasses will be driven by the amount of canopy cover from large trees, particularly the amount and size of stands with closed canopy. When the site is open and tree cover is less than 10 percent, warm season tallgrasses will approach 30 percent species composition by weight, while the cool season grasses will approach 10 percent. As tree cover approaches the upper limit of the reference community (20 percent), cool season grasses and grasslikes will approach 30 percent and warm season tallgrasses will approach 10 percent species composition by weight. Oak, elm, hackberry, cottonwood (Populus deltoids), ash (Fraxinus spp.), black willow (Salix nigra), pecan (Carya illinoensis), and other large trees create 20 percent canopy cover. The overstory canopy is densest adjacent to watercourses. Woody understory species include hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), greenbriar (Smilax spp.), peppervine (Ampelopsis arborea), grape (Vitis spp.), trumpet creeper (Parthenocissus spp.) and honeysuckle (Symphoricarpos spp.). Continuous, year-long grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the reference herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of common Bermudagrass, dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatum), carpetgrass (Axonopus affinis), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and annual sumpweed (Iva annua). The reference Savannah community will shift to the Midgrass Savannah Community (1.2) under the stresses of improper grazing.

Eastern gamagrass, Virginia wildrye, Canada wildrye (Elymus canadensis), sedges (Carex spp.), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) dominate the herbaceous component of the site. Forbs commonly found on the site include tickclover (Desmodium spp.), wildbeans (Strophostyles spp.), lespedezas (Lespedeza spp.), and partridge pea (Chamaecrista fasciculata). Shrub and tree species found in the Tallgrass Savannah Community (1.1) include species of oaks (Quercus spp.), pecan (Carya illinoensis), hackberry, and elm (Ulmus spp.). Vines include greenbrier (Smilax spp.), grape (Vitis spp.), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), and peppervine (Ampelopsis spp.). The reference savannah community will shift to the Midgrass Savannah Community (1.2) under the stresses of improper grazing.

This can occur with or without the understory transitioning to the midgrass community. This transition can occur without degradation of the herbaceous community from dominance by tallgrasses to dominance by midgrasses. Brown and Archer (1999) concluded that even with a healthy and dense stand of grasses, woody species will populate the site and eventually dominate the community. Because the woody species that dominate in the Woodland State are native species that occur as part of the Savannah State, the transition to the Woodland State is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control ceases. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 50 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 50 percent and take management action before the state change occurs.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on moderately deep to deep clay loam soils over limestone. The reference vegetation on these upland sites consists of tallgrasses, numerous forbs, few shrubs and scattered live oak mottes. Without fire or brush management, woody species are likely to increase across the site. Grazing management is key to maintain the reference vegetation.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Clay Loam ecological site, the soils of this site are dark grayish brown, moderately deep to very deep clays or clay loams.

Reference Community
This is the reference or interpretive community for the site. The description is based on early range site descriptions, clipping data, the professional consensus of experienced range specialists, and analysis of field work. In reference condition, this site is a fire/herbivory managed, tallgrass savannah with about 10 percent woody canopy cover. Elm and hackberry trees occur along small streams, and Texas live oak trees or motts are widely scattered. Texas live oak can exist as both a tree and as a mott depending upon fire frequency or other disturbance as it is a vigorous root sprouter. Some juniper may occur depending upon the last fire or removal. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous plant community. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants and may be locally dominant. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass occurred in small quantities. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), silver (Bothriochloa saccharoides), and pinhole bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis var. perforata), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and tall/meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are also prevalent but in lesser amounts. The site grows an abundance of palatable forbs and legumes such as Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), velvet bundleflower (Desmanthus velutinus), and trailing wildbean (Strophostyles helvola). This plant community is very stable and can withstand short term droughts although production will fluctuate accordingly. If the site is abused by overgrazing of the site with cattle, a reduction of the more palatable tall and mid grasses, forbs, and legumes will occur. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver and pinhole bluestem, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) will increase. Texas wintergrass, along with a small amount of wildryes (Elymus spp.), often dominates the site and furnishes considerable cool-season forage. The cool season plants will also be more prominent when abundant fall rains occur. Fire on a 5- to 10-year frequency will help suppress shrubs and add to the cycling of minerals and nutrients. Fires prevent excessive buildup of litter. Research on the effects of fire on soil organisms reveal complex results and are ecosystem dependent. Soil fauna may decrease following a burn if the burn leaves the soil bare and not insulated (Wright, 1982). It is anticipated that a burn on this site, leaving some litter on the soil, may initially depress soil fauna but then experience an increase following a burn mainly because the sun warms the ground quicker. This leads to more rapid nutrient cycling and increased production and quality. In general, if burning follows historic fire return intervals, the litter and soil fauna will be sustainable (Scifres, 1980). Grazing has a dual effect in maintaining this grassland. Grazing assists in nutrient cycling by digesting coarse grasses and depositing the digested plants through manure back to the soil surface. However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

The Tight Sandy Loam ecological sites typically have fine sandy loam and very fine sandy loam surface textures. Tight refers to the sandy clay or clay subsoil that begins about 10 inches below the surface.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are moderately deep to very deep, moderately well to well drained, moderately slowly to very slowly permeable, and strongly acid to slightly alkaline. A typical pedon will exhibit an ochric epipedon, an argillic horizon beginning at 10 inches and depth to secondary carbonates ranging from 28 to 40 inches.

Soils correlated to this site include: Ander, Batesville, Bryde, Czar, Floresville, Gillett, Griter, Miguel, Papalote, and Webb.

Reference Community
The representative plant Community for this ecological site is a diverse Midgrass Community (1.1) with less than five percent woody plant cover. Dominant grasses are two to four feet in tall. Bare ground is minimal. Little bluestem is prevalent in the eastern portion of the MLRA. Multiflower Rhodesgrass, false Rhodesgrass, and Arizona cottontop are more abundant in the drier western part of the MLRA. Subdominant grass species are feathery bluestem and pink pappusgrass. Most common woody species are mesquite, snakewood, and spiny hackberry. The woody species are typically small and obscured by grasses. The majority of production occurs in late spring and early summer when temperatures and moisture are typically most suitable for growth. As conditions become warmer and drier, grasses become dormant and substantial litter accumulation occurs, making the site prone to fire. Recurrent fire (every three to five years) favors persistence of the dominant grasses and keeps the cover of woody plants low. In years without fire, leaf litter decomposes and adds organic matter to the soil, thus enhancing its fertility and water holding capacity. The dominant grasses are also highly productive belowground and are relatively deeply rooted. Extensive root systems bind the soil to minimize erosion while enabling the dominant grasses to access stored soil moisture, thus stabilizing aboveground production. With their high ground cover and large root systems, the dominant grasses tend to monopolize light, water, nutrients, and competitively exclude other plants.

Reference Community
The reference community is dominated by midgrasses. The grassland state is composed of midgrasses with scattered mesquites and associated subordinate shrubs. Mesquite-dominated mottes compose about five percent of the vegetation canopy cover. Heavy grazing or absence of fire shifts community composition to either a short grass community, or to a community dominated by larger mesquites and associated woody plants composing 5 to 20 percent of the canopy cover. Prescribed grazing and prescribed fire at periodic intervals are required to maintain the original midgrass dominated community.

Ecological Site Concept
The Clay Loam ecological site has deep to very deep clay loam soils and has high vegetative production. The Eastern Clay Loams are more productive than the Western Clay Loam sites, with the separation line occurring in Atascosa County.

Soil Features
The soils in the Eastern Clay Loam ecological site are deep to very deep, well drained, and have moderate to very slow permeability. The soils formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene and Holocene age. A typical pedon will have a mollic epipedon, an argillic horizon starting within 10 inches of the surface, and secondary calcium carbonate beginning at about 30 inches. Soil reaction will typically range from neutral to moderately alkaline with percent calcium carbonate increasing with depth. Soils correlated to this site include: Clareville, Coy, Cuero, Marcelinas, and San Antonio.

Reference Community
This community represents the reference plant community. It is a fire-climax, midgrass plant community with less than a five percent canopy of shrubby woody plants. Modern reports (Mann 2004) discuss the importance of human caused fire as an important factor in keeping open grasslands and savannahs prior to European settlement. It is assumed that prior to European settlement, the Midgrass Savannah Community (1.1) occurred over the majority of this ecological site in a dynamically shifting mosaic over time with the Mixedgrass/Mixedbrush Community (2.2) in the Shrubland State (2). Dominant grasses include false Rhodesgrass (Chloris crinita), multiflower Rhodesgrass (Trichloris pluriflora), little bluestem, Arizona cottontop, pink pappusgrass, sideoats grama, buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides), curly-mesquite (Hilaria belangeri), perennial threeawn (Aristida spp.), plains bristlegrass (Setaria spp.), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), and hooded windmillgrass (Chloris cucullata). Forbs are Engelmann's daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), bundleflower (Desmanthus spp.), sensitive briar (Schrankia spp.), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), Mexican sagewort (Artemisia ludoviciana), bushsunflower (Simsia lagasceformis), lazy daisy (Aphanostephus spp.), and annual forbs. The woody species are mesquite, whitebrush, snakewood, spiny hackberry (Celtis pallida), cacti, wolfberry, vine jointfir (Ephedra spp.), desert yaupon (Schaefferia cuneifolia), and guayacan (Guaiacum augustifolium). Because the woody species that dominate the Shrubland State (2) are native species that occur as part of the Savannah State (1), the transition is a linear process with shrubs starting to increase soon after fire or brush control ceases. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will gain in stature and increase to the 20 percent canopy cover level that indicates a state change. This is a continual process. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 20 percent and take management action before the threshold is crossed. There is not a five-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Shrubland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system to cross threshold T1A. Once woody canopy exceeds approximately 20 percent and is taller than three feet (an indication of reproduction capability), threshold T1A has been crossed to the Shrubland State (2). Energy in the form of heavy equipment and/or herbicides will be required along with prescribed grazing to shift the plant community back to the Savannah State (1). The Savannah State (1) can be converted to the Converted State (4) by controlling brush while seeding to native or introduced grasses. It may also be plowed and converted to cropland (T1C). There is essentially no bare soil in this community. Plant basal cover and litter comprise all of the ground cover.

The representative plant Community for this ecological site is a diverse Midgrass Community (1.1) with less than five percent woody plant cover. Dominant grasses are two to four feet in tall. Bare ground is minimal. Little bluestem is prevalent in the eastern portion of the MLRA. Multiflower Rhodesgrass, false Rhodesgrass, and Arizona cottontop are more abundant in the drier western part of the MLRA. Subdominant grass species are feathery bluestem and pink pappusgrass. Most common woody species are mesquite, snakewood, and spiny hackberry. The woody species are typically small and obscured by grasses. The majority of production occurs in late spring and early summer when temperatures and moisture are typically most suitable for growth. As conditions become warmer and drier, grasses become dormant and substantial litter accumulation occurs, making the site prone to fire. Recurrent fire (every three to five years) favors persistence of the dominant grasses and keeps the cover of woody plants low. In years without fire, leaf litter decomposes and adds organic matter to the soil, thus enhancing its fertility and water holding capacity. The dominant grasses are also highly productive belowground and are relatively deeply rooted. Extensive root systems bind the soil to minimize erosion while enabling the dominant grasses to access stored soil moisture, thus stabilizing aboveground production. With their high ground cover and large root systems, the dominant grasses tend to monopolize light, water, nutrients, and competitively exclude other plants.

Ecological Site Concept
The Loamy Sand site has a sandy surface over a loamy or clayey subsoil. These sites are located on uplands or stream terraces.

Soil Features
This site consists of deep to very deep, moderately well and well drained soils 50 to 80 inches over eolian sediments, alluvial sediments, and sandstone. Sandy surface thickness ranges from 10 inches to 40 inches before an increase in clay content is noticed, also called the argillic horizon. Secondary calcium carbonate is at depths deeper than 35 inches. Runoff is negligible to low. Soils correlated to this site include: Alum, Comitas, Duval, Leming, Poth and Wilco.

Reference Community
The reference community is dominated by midgrasses. The grassland state is composed of midgrasses with scattered mesquites and associated subordinate shrubs. Mesquite-dominated mottes compose about five percent of the vegetation canopy cover. Heavy grazing or absence of fire shifts community composition to either a short grass community, or to a community dominated by larger mesquites and associated woody plants composing 5 to 20 percent of the canopy cover. Prescribed grazing and prescribed fire at periodic intervals are required to maintain the original midgrass dominated community.

Reference Community
The Mixed-grass Savannah Community (1.1) is the reference community and is characterized as a hardwood savannah with up to 20 percent tree and shrub canopy cover. Historic records from the 1700's indicate that early settlers and explorers found portions of this site to be heavily wooded. Other reports (Mann 2004) discuss the importance of human caused fire as an important factor in keeping open grasslands prior to European settlement. It is assumed the Mixed-grass Savannah Community (1.1) occurred over the majority of this ecological site in a dynamically shifting mosaic over time with the other two communities in the Savannah State. Little bluestem, Virginia wildrye, Canada wildrye, sedges, switchgrass, Indiangrass, beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) dominate the herbaceous component of the site. Forbs commonly found on the site include tickclover (Desmodium spp.), wildbeans (Strophostyles spp.), lespedezas (Lespedeza spp.), and partridge pea (Chamaecrista fasciculata). Shrub and tree species found in the Mixed-grass Savannah Community (1.1) include species of oaks, pecan, hackberry (Celtis spp.), and elm (Ulmus spp.). Vines include greenbrier (Smilax spp.), grape (Vitis spp.), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), and peppervine (Ampelopsis spp.). The reference savannah community will shift to the Midgrass Savannah Community (1.2) under the stresses of improper grazing. The first species to decrease in dominance will be the most palatable grasses and forbs. This will initially result in an increase in composition of little bluestem and paspalums. If improper grazing continues, little bluestem will decrease and midgrasses such as broomsedge bluestem (Andropogon virginicus), and Vasey's grass (Paspalum urvillei). Less palatable forbs will also increase at this stage. Without fire and/or brush control, woody species on the site will increase and transition the site to the Woodland State (2). This can occur with or without the understory transitioning to the Midgrass community. This transition can occur without degradation of the herbaceous community from dominance by tallgrasses and palatable midgrasses to dominance by midgrasses. Brown and Archer (1999) concluded that even with a healthy and dense stand of grasses, woody species will populate the site and eventually dominate the community. Because the dominant woody species in the Woodland State are native species that occur as part of the Savannah State, the transition to the Woodland State is a linear process, with shrubs increasing soon after fire or brush control ceases. Unless some form of brush control takes place, woody species will increase to the 50 percent canopy cover that indicates a state change. This is a continual process. Managers need to detect the increase in woody species when canopy is less than 50 percent and take management action before the state change occurs. There is not a 10-year window before shrubs begin to increase followed by a rapid transition to the Woodland State. The drivers of the transition (lack of fire and lack of brush control) constantly pressure the system towards the Woodland State. The soils of this site are deep, loamy textured, and moderately permeable. The site generally receives additional water from outside the site. Infiltration is moderate and runoff is low. There is essentially no bare soil in this community. Plant basal cover and litter comprise all of the ground cover. Soils are highly fertile and hold moderately large amounts of soil moisture. This is a very productive site with high yields of good quality forage.

Soil Features
The soils of this site are very deep, loamy textured, and moderately permeable. They usually receive extra water as overflow from watercourses or as runoff from adjacent higher sites. They are, however, better drained than the Clayey Bottomland sites. The plant-soil- water-air relationship is very favorable for plant growth.

Sedges, Virginia wildrye, switchcane, broadleaf woodoats (Chasmanthium latifolium), and rustyseed paspalum (Paspalum langei) in shaded and wet areas dominate the herbaceous plant community. Various combinations of beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), switchgrass, Indiangrass, big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), eastern gamagrass, vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and Florida paspalum (Paspalum floridanum) may dominate drier, open areas. Continuous yearlong grazing for a succession of years will tend to move the reference herbaceous plant community towards a herbaceous community of common Bermudagrass, dallisgrass, Vasey's grass (Paspalum urvillei), carpetgrass, giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida), and annual sumpweed (Iva annua). Prescribed grazing may shift this herbaceous community back towards the reference herbaceous species. Continuous yearlong grazing with no weed or brush management or abandoning the site for several years will tend to move towards a shrub-sapling community. Once woody shrubs and saplings invade the site, brush management in some form must be used to move back toward the Savannah State.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on moderately deep to deep clay loam soils over limestone. The reference vegetation on these upland sites consists of tallgrasses, numerous forbs, few shrubs and scattered live oak mottes. Without fire or brush management, woody species are likely to increase across the site. Grazing management is key to maintain the reference vegetation.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Clay Loam ecological site, the soils of this site are dark grayish brown, moderately deep to very deep clays or clay loams. Limestone fragments and rocks sometimes occur in the profile or outcrop on the soil surface, but not to the extent that they impair the production of native vegetation. Plant-soil moisture relationships are good. In healthy condition, rills, gullies, wind-scoured areas, pedestals, and soil compaction layers are not present on the site. It should be noted that there may be inclusions of other soils that because of mapping scale are not divided out. These may include some shallow soils with sporadic surface limestone fragments typical of the Eckrant series. The following representative soils associated with the Clay Loam ecological site are Bolar, Krum, and Pratley. These are the representative map units associated with the Clay Loam ecological site: Bolar clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes Krum clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes Krum clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes Krum-Pratley association, gently undulating Pratley clay, 0 to 3 percent slopes

Reference Community
This is the reference or interpretive community for the site. The description is based on early range site descriptions, clipping data, the professional consensus of experienced range specialists, and analysis of field work. In reference condition, this site is a fire/herbivory managed, tallgrass savannah with about 10 percent woody canopy cover. Elm and hackberry trees occur along small streams, and Texas live oak trees or motts are widely scattered. Texas live oak can exist as both a tree and as a mott depending upon fire frequency or other disturbance as it is a vigorous root sprouter. Some juniper may occur depending upon the last fire or removal. Little bluestem dominates the herbaceous plant community. Indiangrass and big bluestem are subdominants and may be locally dominant. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass occurred in small quantities. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), silver (Bothriochloa saccharoides), and pinhole bluestem (Bothriochloa barbinodis var. perforata), vine mesquite (Panicum obtusum), and tall/meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus) are also prevalent but in lesser amounts. The site grows an abundance of palatable forbs and legumes such as Engelmann daisy (Engelmannia peristenia), orange zexmenia (Wedelia hispida), velvet bundleflower (Desmanthus velutinus), and trailing wildbean (Strophostyles helvola). This plant community is very stable and can withstand short term droughts although production will fluctuate accordingly. If the site is abused by overgrazing of the site with cattle, a reduction of the more palatable tall and mid grasses, forbs, and legumes will occur. Sideoats grama, Texas wintergrass, silver and pinhole bluestem, and buffalograss (Bouteloua dactyloides) will increase. Texas wintergrass, along with a small amount of wildryes (Elymus spp.), often dominates the site and furnishes considerable cool-season forage. The cool season plants will also be more prominent when abundant fall rains occur. Fire on a 5- to 10-year frequency will help suppress shrubs and add to the cycling of minerals and nutrients. Fires prevent excessive buildup of litter. Research on the effects of fire on soil organisms reveal complex results and are ecosystem dependent. Soil fauna may decrease following a burn if the burn leaves the soil bare and not insulated (Wright, 1982). It is anticipated that a burn on this site, leaving some litter on the soil, may initially depress soil fauna but then experience an increase following a burn mainly because the sun warms the ground quicker. This leads to more rapid nutrient cycling and increased production and quality. In general, if burning follows historic fire return intervals, the litter and soil fauna will be sustainable (Scifres, 1980). Grazing has a dual effect in maintaining this grassland. Grazing assists in nutrient cycling by digesting coarse grasses and depositing the digested plants through manure back to the soil surface. However, overgrazing can damage the plant community, create bare ground, and remove any opportunity for burning. Wildlife species such as birds and small mammals as well as livestock transport a variety of seeds onto the site. Shrubs will begin to establish under perches and cover for wildlife which is a place for new seedlings to establish. Once this begins to happen, the community is increasingly at risk of change. The plant community can be restored if an integrated regime of fire, maintenance brush, and proper grazing is completed. If these disturbances are not present, the 1.1 Tallgrass Savannah plant community will shift to the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community. This is within a normal range of variability for this site but if left long enough without the disturbances, the 1.2 Mid/Tallgrass Savannah plant community will transition into the Shrubland community (3) over time. If mechanical or chemical brush management were applied successfully, this community could also exist as an open, native, tallgrass prairie until the shrubs/trees inevitably reestablish. Continued mechanical or chemical suppression treatments would be needed in this case.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on drainages with deep alluvial soils. Reference vegetation includes a mixture of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. Overtime, without fire or brush management, woody species may dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Loamy Bottomland ecological site, the soils are very deep, loamy, and calcareous. They are well drained, and permeability is moderate to rapid. The site receives extra water from stream flooding and as runoff from adjacent higher sites. Surface runoff is slow and some areas are flooded for short periods. The soils have a high water holding capacity for plant use and are naturally fertile. The soil maybe underlain with material comprised of 65 to 90 percent rounded alluvial gravels, cobbles, and stones at depths of 12 to greater than 80 inches. The site produces high yields of palatable and nutritious forage. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site.

Reference Community
This plant community is a Tallgrass Savannah Bottomland with high plant diversity and structure. The information for this plant community is interpolated from historical writings, NRCS range site descriptions, limited clipping studies, and professional consensus. This is the diagnostic or reference plant community for the Loamy Bottomland site. Pecan, live oak, walnut, sycamore, cypress, hackberry (Celtis spp.), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia.), western soapberry (Sapindus saponaria), cottonwood, and willow (Salix spp.) shade 10 to 30 percent of the ground. This is the preferred site for pecan. The understory is composed principally of little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, southwestern bristlegrass, Virginia wildrye, and perennial forbs, with smaller amounts of shrubs and woody vines. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass, along with numerous forbs and browse species occur immediately adjacent to watercourses. These species have a positive effect on streambank stabilization during flooding events. Removal of these species by over-harvesting and other effects leads to increased streambank erosion and drainage of the water table in some instances. Plants growing at the edge of the stream such as spikerush (Eliocharis spp.) and knotgrass (Paspalum distichum) can exhibit above ground production levels of 6,198 pounds per acre with root biomass of 27, 667 and 24,527 pounds per acre respectively. Root lengths of these plants have been recorded as high as 22 and 18.8 miles per square foot respectively (Cornwall, 1998). Any impact that excessively removes leaf material of the grasses over long periods of time will force a vegetational shift from tallgrass to midgrass then eventually to a cool season grass community. Birds import seeds from numerous tree and shrub species, the major one being Ashe juniper. Left unmanaged, the site will transition to a woodland of hardwood species with a dense understory of juniper and other shrubby species. Canopy cover can then be as high as 100 percent.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on drainages with deep alluvial soils. Reference vegetation includes a mixture of trees, shrubs and herbaceous plants. Overtime, without fire or brush management, woody species may dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Loamy Bottomland ecological site, the soils are very deep, loamy, and calcareous. They are well drained, and permeability is moderate to rapid. The site receives extra water from stream flooding and as runoff from adjacent higher sites. Surface runoff is slow and some areas are flooded for short periods. The soils have a high water holding capacity for plant use and are naturally fertile. The soil maybe underlain with material comprised of 65 to 90 percent rounded alluvial gravels, cobbles, and stones at depths of 12 to greater than 80 inches.

Reference Community
This plant community is a Tallgrass Savannah Bottomland with high plant diversity and structure. The information for this plant community is interpolated from historical writings, NRCS range site descriptions, limited clipping studies, and professional consensus. This is the diagnostic or reference plant community for the Loamy Bottomland site. Pecan, live oak, walnut, sycamore, cypress, hackberry (Celtis spp.), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia.), western soapberry (Sapindus saponaria), cottonwood, and willow (Salix spp.) shade 10 to 30 percent of the ground. This is the preferred site for pecan. The understory is composed principally of little bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, southwestern bristlegrass, Virginia wildrye, and perennial forbs, with smaller amounts of shrubs and woody vines. Switchgrass and eastern gamagrass, along with numerous forbs and browse species occur immediately adjacent to watercourses. These species have a positive effect on streambank stabilization during flooding events. Removal of these species by over-harvesting and other effects leads to increased streambank erosion and drainage of the water table in some instances. Plants growing at the edge of the stream such as spikerush (Eliocharis spp.) and knotgrass (Paspalum distichum) can exhibit above ground production levels of 6,198 pounds per acre with root biomass of 27, 667 and 24,527 pounds per acre respectively. Root lengths of these plants have been recorded as high as 22 and 18.8 miles per square foot respectively (Cornwall, 1998). Any impact that excessively removes leaf material of the grasses over long periods of time will force a vegetational shift from tallgrass to midgrass then eventually to a cool season grass community. Birds import seeds from numerous tree and shrub species, the major one being Ashe juniper. Left unmanaged, the site will transition to a woodland of hardwood species with a dense understory of juniper and other shrubby species. Canopy cover can then be as high as 100 percent.

Ecological Site Concept
The Redlands Ecological Site has non-calcareous soils over limestone. The reference vegetation is an oak savannah with mid and tallgrasses, forbs and few shrubs. Without periodic fire or brush management, woody species will likely increase and dominate the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Redland ecological site, the soils are shallow, brown or reddish brown, fertile clays, and clay loams. They are underlain by slightly fractured indurated limestone bedrock at depths of 20 inches or less. Plant roots penetrate the crevices, which are usually filled with reddish brown clay. Limestone fragments, cherts, cobbles and stones sometimes occur on the surface and may make up as much as 25 percent of the soil by volume. When dry, the soils crack and take in water rapidly. When wet, the cracks close, and the soils become sticky and plastic and take in water slowly. Light showers are ineffective on the site, which favors the growth of deep-rooted perennial plants. When plant residues are inadequate, soil condition deteriorates and heavy surface crusts develop. In this condition water intake is very slow, runoff is rapid, erosion is a hazard, and grass recovery is slow. The stones on the surface reduce surface evaporation and help protect palatable grasses and forbs from overuse. The mineral content and reaction of these soils enable the site to produce highly nutritious forage. In association with other sites, Redland is usually the preferred grazing area. These sites occur on more stable hillslopes on dissected plateaus. Due to the scale of mapping, there are inclusions of minor components of other soils within these mapping units. Before performing any inventories, conduct a field evaluation to ensure the soils are correct for the site. The representative map units associated with the Redland ecological site are: Hensley association, undulating Tarpley association, undulating

Reference Community
The Oak Savannah Community (1.1) is the interpretive plant community. This plant community is a fire/grazing managed savannah composed of tall grasses. The overstory shades around10 percent of the site and consists primarily of post oak, but may include Bigelow oak (Quercus buckleyi), Texas red oak (Quercus texana), Texas live oak, blackjack oak and several associated species. The post oak and blackjack oak are signature key indicators of the Redland site. Occasionally however there may only be Texas live oak. The role of historic fire and bison grazing was to keep sunlight energy flowing through the deep-rooted trees and grasses, accelerate the mineral and nutrient cycle and to capture the optimum amount of rainfall. The removal or alteration of these ecological disturbances will trigger the plant community to change. The total removal of grazing animals may, in fact, accelerate this change. Juniper is added to the site via droppings from perching birds and small mammals that eat the seeds. Ashe juniper, which is a nonsprouting woody plant easily controlled by fire, and other woody species will increase without fire or some form of brush management. Once Ashe juniper encroachments it can easily be controlled with prescribed fire. When the juniper exceeds about 6 feet in height, fire options become limited. Without intervention, the Ashe juniper will continue to increase and move towards the Oak/Juniper Grassland plant community (1.2). This may occur in as little as five years.

Ecological Site Concept
These sites occur on shallow calcareous clays over hard limestone. Reference vegetation includes tall and midgrasses, numerous forbs, and few scattered shrubs. Without periodic fire or other brush management, juniper and other woody species are likely to increase on the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Shallow ecological site, the soils are shallow, calcareous clays. The soil material is underlain by hard limestone at a depth of 8 to 20 inches. Limestone fragments are typically less than 15 percent by volume but may range up to 35 percent. These soils take in water readily when they have good cover of mid to tall grasses and plant residue. Surface crusting is common when plant cover and soil conditions deteriorate. Fractures in the limestone bedrock generally contain fine soil particles and store moisture. Plant roots penetrate these cracks and crevices, and thus have access to more moisture and plant nutrients than is apparent in the soil. The plants on this site are relatively unpalatable because of low phosphorus content which occurs because of the limited depth and high lime content. It should be noted that this site may contain small inclusions of other soils/sites, such as Clay Loam or Low Stony Hill, that were not delineated separately because of mapping intensity. Field investigations and verification should always preclude any inventory efforts. The following representative soils associated with the Shallow ecological site are Doss and Purves. These are the representative map units associated with the Shallow ecological site: Doss silty clay, 1 to 5 percent slopes Doss-Brackett association, undulating Purves association, undulating

Reference Community
The reference plant community is a fire managed, tall and midgrass prairie or savannah. Texas live oak trees and mottes are widely scattered, but make up less than 5 percent canopy. Little bluestem is the dominant plant on the site. Big bluestem and Indiangrass occupy favorable micro-sites and can be locally prominent. Also occurring on the site but less frequently or in smaller amounts are sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), tall dropseed (Sporobolus compositus), feather bluestem (Bothriochloa spp.), Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), eastern gamagrass (Tripsacum dactyloides), and other grasses. Many forbs are endemic to the site adding color to the landscape and providing variety to the diet of the animal community. The mixture of animals using the site will change the plant composition. Overgrazing the plant community with cattle will lead to a reduction in little bluestem, big bluestem, and Indiangrass. If the site is heavily stocked with multiple species such as cattle, sheep, goats, and wildlife the site will shift toward a plant community with very little herbaceous cover and woody trees leaving shrubs with browse lines. Research indicates juniper can establish on both overgrazed and properly grazed rangeland on this site unless goats and probably sheep are utilized (Taylor, 1997; Anderson, et al., 2013). Wildlife species are a vector in spreading the seeds through droppings. Evidence of this is observed along fence lines and under trees. Without fire on a return interval of 3 to 5 years or with managed goat grazing, the site will cross a threshold of 5 to 10 percent canopy to a Prairie Shrubland Community (2.1) in as little as 5 to 8 years. In order to implement prescribed burning, prescribed grazing is essential. This plant community can have approximately 3,800 pounds per acre of fine fuels (1 hour) accumulation with long periods of no grazing because of carryover vegetation.

Ecological Site Concept
These upland sites occur on gravelly clay loam soils over limestone. Gravel content ranges up to 25 percent at the surface to 80 percent in the subsoil. Reference vegetation includes mid and tallgrasses with numerous forbs and scattered oaks. Without fire or other brush management, woody species are likely to increase on the site.

Soil Features
In a representative profile for the Gravelly Redland ecological site, the surface layer is dark reddish-brown gravelly clay loam about 5 inches thick. They are underlain by slightly fractured indurated limestone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments in the surface horizons are about 25 percent and up to 80 percent in the subsoil. There are gravelly to extremely gravelly texture modifiers throughout the soil profile. Because of the moderate slopes associated with Gravelly Redland, the site is well drained and has moderate runoff. The high gravel content in the subsurface horizons reduces the shrink-swell potential which causes the soil permeability to be moderately slow. When plant residues are inadequate, soil condition deteriorates and heavy surface crusts develop. In this condition water intake is very slow, runoff is rapid, erosion is a hazard, and grass recovery is slow. The mineral content and reaction of these soils enable the site to produce highly nutritious forage. In association with other sites, Gravelly Redland is usually the preferred grazing area.

Reference Community
This is the diagnostic or reference plant community for the Gravelly Redland site. The metrics of the description of the reference plant community is derived from field observations, limited clipping data and professional consensus. The plant community is perceived as a prairie composed of mostly midgrasses with scattered tallgrasses, trees and shrubs. It evolved under the influence of grazing, periodic fire and a subtropical climate. Wildfires set either by Indians or lightning, occurred at 7 to 12 year intervals (Frost, 1998). Woody plants, consisting of scattered trees or shrub mottes, shaded less than 10 percent of the site. Live oak, hackberry (Celtis spp.) and shrubs such as catclaw acacia, sumac (Rhus spp.), elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens), ephedra (Ephedra spp.), algerita, bumelia (Sideroxylon lanuginosum), and pricklypear (Opuntia spp.) were likely present but were kept suppressed by periodic fires and competition from the grasses. Above ground plant production ranged from 2,000 to 4,500 pounds per year. The grassland component accounted for 85 to 90 percent of the sites primary production, with little bluestem and sideoats grama the most abundant and productive species. Big bluestem and Indiangrass were confined to draws and wetter areas. Secondary midgrasses were Arizona cottontop (Digitaria californica), silver bluestem (Bothriochloa laguroides var. torreyana), green sprangletop (Leptochloa dubia), Texas cupgrass (Eriochloa sericea), and Texas wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha). Shortgrasses, like buffalograss and curlymesquite (Hilaria belangeri), were present in small amounts. Mexican sagewort (Artemisia ludoviciana), catclaw sensitivebriar (Mimosa nuttallii), bundleflower, western indigo, and orange zexmenia (Zexmenia spp.) were a few of the small (5 to 7 percent) but important forb components of the plant community (See Plant Community Composition and Annual Production table below). Soil erosion, particularly on the upland plain areas, was very low because of the abundant plant cover, litter, good soil structure, and abundant chert outcrops. Runoff from the reference plant community was reduced because of grass cover and fissures in the limestone parent material. The vegetative ground cover helped disperse and slow down runoff, thus holding soil in place and enhancing infiltration. Concentrated water flow patterns were rare in this plant community.
