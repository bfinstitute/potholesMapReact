Make it best for low-income residents, with expanded and improved bus stop shelters that provide protection from the sun and rain, add more stops on routes to and from the east, west and south sides to central downtown - that’s how you build equity.

Older neighborhoods offer more than housing opportunities, they offer walkable neighborhoods with easier access to public transit.

Nice cities work because of a few main things namely density of goods and services (lowers fixed costs and cost of access) and they have large sets of high earning people to keep a range of options in business ","Nice homes and room to grow in D1 e.g. project marvel, development in Lavaca ","Lack of job opportunities, Inadequate training or education programs, Transportation challenges, Both right? In an issue in that city budgets need to be balanced as so investment in supply or demand side (companies, infrastructure or people) are all constrained. The huge shy return investment is probably built environment and people/education. Make smart people and place people want to be and growth will happen.  ","Tech and digital skills, Green jobs/sustainability sectors, University and programs to help high school kids perform and go to school. We have world class universities in our city (Birds Up) and the economy is becoming more not less advanced. We need to teach people (how to think) in addition to the normal and increasing (and misled) focus on training (skills, which become dated). ","Of course! We are lucky to have an incredibly robust public sector between our utilities CPS Energy and SAWS which are government owned contribute 25% of the cities discretionary budget, to universities and the military. Our public sector should help lead and grow private sector opportunities. ",Walking,Neutral,"More frequent bus service, Expanded routes or better coverage, More sidewalks, Reduced traffic congestion, Safer streets","Lucky to be in Southtown, but in other areas mixed use spaces are lacking. All areas should have some mix of healthcare, food, recreation, and jobs. ",Yes,"Arts, entertainment, music, Growing Tech Hub scene, San Antonio International Airport Expansion, Access to top-tier universities and research institutions, Larger military presence, Low cost of living, All of the above are excellent for SA. I think SA should build around what it does best and is known for UTSA, CPS Energy, SAWS and SARA, and the Spurs are all world class institutions that make the city go, with the first 4 being public actors and solely led by public purpose and the latter being the thing that puts us on the global map ( along with our heritage and history). Invest in these. ",Positive,"Built environment (I’d say this is key but captures a few—affordable, enjoyable, sustainable and resilient places that people want to be in) ",Very connected,10,Healthcare services,"San Antonio, riddle by a real history of poverty and inequality, is often overly focused on cost and approaches development with an outdated and negative bias (even if understandable in part). We need to focus on BENEFITS and not just cost. Lowering costs on a fixed budget will still not make you wealthy, similarly redistribution or a focus on it cannot itself solve poverty. When we DONT do competitive things, the lost opportunity is almost certainly larger than the explicit cost that would hav even incurred. Of course we need focused policy and clear discussion of tradeoffs between our budget, different opportunities, and real sensitivities and issues in our communities. But economic growth is good, benefits of it almost by definition outweigh the costs, and experts can help us design this future. Thanks for yalls work to lead that! "
